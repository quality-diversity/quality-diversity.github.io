- abstract: 'Crystal structures are indispensable across various domains, from 

    batteries to solar cells, and extensive research has been dedicated to 
    
    predicting their properties based on their atomic configurations.
    
    However, prevailing Crystal Structure Prediction methods focus on identifying 
    
    the most stable solutions that lie at the global minimum of the energy function.
    
    This approach overlooks other potentially interesting materials that lie in
    
    neighbouring local minima and have different material properties such as 
    
    conductivity or resistance to deformation. By contrast, Quality-Diversity 
    
    algorithms provide a promising avenue for Crystal Structure Prediction as 
    
    they aim to find a collection of high-performing solutions that have diverse
    
    characteristics. However, it may also be valuable to optimise for the
    
    stability of crystal structures alongside other objectives such as magnetism
    
    or thermoelectric efficiency. Therefore, in this work, we harness the power
    
    of Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity algorithms in order to find crystal
    
    structures which have diverse features and achieve different trade-offs of
    
    objectives. We analyse our approach on 5 crystal systems and demonstrate
    
    that it is not only able to re-discover known real-life structures, but also
    
    find promising new ones. Moreover, we propose a method for illuminating the
    
    objective space to gain an understanding of what trade-offs can be achieved.'

- abstract: 'As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent across
    many

    real-world applications, understanding and enhancing their robustness to user

    inputs is of paramount importance. Existing methods for identifying adversarial

    prompts tend to focus on specific domains, lack diversity, or require extensive

    human annotations. To address these limitations, we present Rainbow Teaming, a

    novel approach for producing a diverse collection of adversarial prompts.

    Rainbow Teaming casts adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity

    problem, and uses open-ended search to generate prompts that are both effective

    and diverse. It can uncover a model''s vulnerabilities across a broad range of

    domains including, in this paper, safety, question answering, and

    cybersecurity. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning on synthetic data generated

    by Rainbow Teaming improves the safety of state-of-the-art LLMs without hurting

    their general capabilities and helpfulness, paving the path to open-ended

    self-improvement.'

- abstract: 'Despite recent advancements in AI for robotics, grasping remains a partially

    solved challenge, hindered by the lack of benchmarks and reproducibility

    constraints. This paper introduces a vision-based grasping framework that can

    easily be transferred across multiple manipulators. Leveraging

    Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, the framework generates diverse repertoires

    of open-loop grasping trajectories, enhancing adaptability while maintaining a

    diversity of grasps. This framework addresses two main issues: the lack of an

    off-the-shelf vision module for detecting object pose and the generalization of

    QD trajectories to the whole robot operational space. The proposed solution

    combines multiple vision modules for 6DoF object detection and tracking while

    rigidly transforming QD-generated trajectories into the object frame.

    Experiments on a Franka Research 3 arm and a UR5 arm with a SIH Schunk hand

    demonstrate comparable performance when the real scene aligns with the

    simulation used for grasp generation. This work represents a significant stride

    toward building a reliable vision-based grasping module transferable to new

    platforms, while being adaptable to diverse scenarios without further training

    iterations.'

- abstract: 'Complex system design problems, such as those involved in aerospace

    engineering, require the use of numerically costly simulation codes in order to

    predict the performance of the system to be designed. In this context, these

    codes are often embedded into an optimization process to provide the best

    design while satisfying the design constraints. Recently, new approaches,

    called Quality-Diversity, have been proposed in order to enhance the

    exploration of the design space and to provide a set of optimal diversified

    solutions with respect to some feature functions. These functions are

    interesting to assess trade-offs. Furthermore, complex design problems often

    involve mixed continuous, discrete, and categorical design variables allowing

    to take into account technological choices in the optimization problem.

    Existing Bayesian Quality-Diversity approaches suited for intensive

    high-fidelity simulations are not adapted to mixed variables constrained

    optimization problems. In order to overcome these limitations, a new

    Quality-Diversity methodology based on mixed variables Bayesian optimization

    strategy is proposed in the context of limited simulation budget. Using adapted

    covariance models and dedicated enrichment strategy for the Gaussian processes

    in Bayesian optimization, this approach allows to reduce the computational cost

    up to two orders of magnitude, with respect to classical Quality-Diversity

    approaches while dealing with discrete choices and the presence of constraints.

    The performance of the proposed method is assessed on a benchmark of analytical

    problems as well as on two aerospace system design problems highlighting its

    efficiency in terms of speed of convergence. The proposed approach provides

    valuable trade-offs for decision-markers for complex system design.'

- abstract: 'Recent advances in AI have led to significant results in robotic learning,

    including natural language-conditioned planning and efficient optimization of

    controllers using generative models. However, the interaction data remains the

    bottleneck for generalization. Getting data for grasping is a critical

    challenge, as this skill is required to complete many manipulation tasks.

    Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms optimize a set of solutions to get diverse,

    high-performing solutions to a given problem. This paper investigates how QD

    can be combined with priors to speed up the generation of diverse grasps poses

    in simulation compared to standard 6-DoF grasp sampling schemes. Experiments

    conducted on 4 grippers with 2-to-5 fingers on standard objects show that QD

    outperforms commonly used methods by a large margin. Further experiments show

    that QD optimization automatically finds some efficient priors that are usually

    hard coded. The deployment of generated grasps on a 2-finger gripper and an

    Allegro hand shows that the diversity produced maintains sim-to-real

    transferability. We believe these results to be a significant step toward the

    generation of large datasets that can lead to robust and generalizing robotic

    grasping policies.'

- abstract: 'Robotic grasping refers to making a robotic system pick an object by
    applying

    forces and torques on its surface. Many recent studies use data-driven

    approaches to address grasping, but the sparse reward nature of this task made

    the learning process challenging to bootstrap. To avoid constraining the

    operational space, an increasing number of works propose grasping datasets to

    learn from. But most of them are limited to simulations. The present paper

    investigates how automatically generated grasps can be exploited in the real

    world. More than 7000 reach-and-grasp trajectories have been generated with

    Quality-Diversity (QD) methods on 3 different arms and grippers, including

    parallel fingers and a dexterous hand, and tested in the real world. Conducted

    analysis on the collected measure shows correlations between several Domain

    Randomization-based quality criteria and sim-to-real transferability. Key

    challenges regarding the reality gap for grasping have been identified,

    stressing matters on which researchers on grasping should focus in the future.

    A QD approach has finally been proposed for making grasps more robust to domain

    randomization, resulting in a transfer ratio of 84% on the Franka Research 3

    arm.'

- abstract: 'Quality-Diversity (QD) methods are algorithms that aim to generate a
    set of

    diverse and high-performing solutions to a given problem. Originally developed

    for evolutionary robotics, most QD studies are conducted on a limited set of

    domains - mainly applied to locomotion, where the fitness and the behavior

    signal are dense. Grasping is a crucial task for manipulation in robotics.

    Despite the efforts of many research communities, this task is yet to be

    solved. Grasping cumulates unprecedented challenges in QD literature: it

    suffers from reward sparsity, behavioral sparsity, and behavior space

    misalignment. The present work studies how QD can address grasping. Experiments

    have been conducted on 15 different methods on 10 grasping domains,

    corresponding to 2 different robot-gripper setups and 5 standard objects. An

    evaluation framework that distinguishes the evaluation of an algorithm from its

    internal components has also been proposed for a fair comparison. The obtained

    results show that MAP-Elites variants that select successful solutions in

    priority outperform all the compared methods on the studied metrics by a large

    margin. We also found experimental evidence that sparse interaction can lead to

    deceptive novelty. To our knowledge, the ability to efficiently produce

    examples of grasping trajectories demonstrated in this work has no precedent in

    the literature.'

  abstract: "In many real-world systems, such as adaptive robotics, achieving a single, optimised solution may be insufficient. Instead, a diverse set of high-performing solutions is often required to adapt to varying contexts and requirements. This is the realm of Quality-Diversity (QD), which aims to discover a collection of high-performing solutions, each with their own unique characteristics. QD methods have recently seen success in many domains, including robotics, where they have been used to discover damage-adaptive locomotion controllers. However, most existing work has focused on single-agent settings, despite many tasks of interest being multi-agent. To this end, we introduce Mix-ME, a novel multi-agent variant of the popular MAP-Elites algorithm that forms new solutions using a crossover-like operator by mixing together agents from different teams. We evaluate the proposed methods on a variety of partially observable continuous control tasks. Our evaluation shows that these multi-agent variants obtained by Mix-ME not only compete with single-agent baselines but also often outperform them in multi-agent settings under partial observability."

  abstract:
    "Pre-training a diverse set of neural network controllers in simulation has
    enabled robots to adapt online to damage in robot locomotion tasks. However,
    finding diverse, high-performing controllers requires expensive network
    training and extensive tuning of a large number of hyperparameters. On the
    other hand, Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Annealing (CMA-MAE), an
    evolution strategies (ES)-based quality diversity algorithm, does not have
    these limitations and has achieved state-of-the-art performance on standard
    QD benchmarks. However, CMA-MAE cannot scale to modern neural network
    controllers due to its quadratic complexity. We leverage efficient
    approximation methods in ES to propose three new CMA-MAE variants that scale
    to high dimensions. Our experiments show that the variants outperform
    ES-based baselines in benchmark robotic locomotion tasks, while being
    comparable with or exceeding state-of-the-art deep reinforcement
    learning-based quality diversity algorithms."

- abstract: 'This paper proposes a novel method for estimating the set of plausible
    poses

    of a rigid object from a set of points with volumetric information, such as

    whether each point is in free space or on the surface of the object. In

    particular, we study how pose can be estimated from force and tactile data

    arising from contact. Using data derived from contact is challenging because it

    is inherently less information-dense than visual data, and thus the pose

    estimation problem is severely under-constrained when there are few contacts.

    Rather than attempting to estimate the true pose of the object, which is not

    tractable without a large number of contacts, we seek to estimate a plausible

    set of poses which obey the constraints imposed by the sensor data. Existing

    methods struggle to estimate this set because they are either designed for

    single pose estimates or require informative priors to be effective. Our

    approach to this problem, Constrained pose Hypothesis Set Elimination (CHSEL),

    has three key attributes: 1) It considers volumetric information, which allows

    us to account for known free space; 2) It uses a novel differentiable

    volumetric cost function to take advantage of powerful gradient-based

    optimization tools; and 3) It uses methods from the Quality Diversity (QD)

    optimization literature to produce a diverse set of high-quality poses. To our

    knowledge, QD methods have not been used previously for pose registration. We

    also show how to update our plausible pose estimates online as more data is

    gathered by the robot. Our experiments suggest that CHSEL shows large

    performance improvements over several baseline methods for both simulated and

    real-world data.'

    those which excel at a few objectives at the cost of the others. Keeping only

  title: A discretization-free metric for assessing quality diversity algorithms
  year: 2022

- abstract: 'While standard approaches to optimisation focus on producing a single

    high-performing solution, Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms allow large diverse

    collections of such solutions to be found. If QD has proven promising across a

    large variety of domains, it still struggles when faced with uncertain domains,

    where quantification of performance and diversity are non-deterministic.

    Previous work in Uncertain Quality-Diversity (UQD) has proposed methods and

    metrics designed for such uncertain domains. In this paper, we propose a first

    set of benchmark tasks to analyse and estimate the performance of UQD

    algorithms. We identify the key uncertainty properties to easily define UQD

    benchmark tasks: the uncertainty location, the type of distribution and its

    parameters. By varying the nature of those key UQD components, we introduce a

    set of 8 easy-to-implement and lightweight tasks, split into 3 main categories.

    All our tasks build on the Redundant Arm: a common QD environment that is

    lightweight and easily replicable. Each one of these tasks highlights one

    specific limitation that arises when considering UQD domains. With this first

    benchmark, we hope to facilitate later advances in UQD.'

- abstract: 'Evolvability refers to the ability of an individual genotype (solution)
    to

    produce offspring with mutually diverse phenotypes. Recent research has

    demonstrated that divergent search methods, particularly novelty search,

    promote evolvability by implicitly creating selective pressure for it. The main

    objective of this paper is to provide a novel perspective on the relationship

    between neuroevolutionary divergent search and evolvability. In order to

    achieve this, several types of walks from the literature on fitness landscape

    analysis are first adapted to this context. Subsequently, the interplay between

    neuroevolutionary divergent search and evolvability under varying amounts of

    evolutionary pressure and under different diversity metrics is investigated. To

    this end, experiments are performed on Fetch Pick and Place, a robotic arm

    task. Moreover, the performed study in particular sheds light on the structure

    of the genotype-phenotype mapping (the behavior landscape). Finally, a novel

    definition of evolvability that takes into account the evolvability of

    offspring and is appropriate for use with discretized behavior spaces is

    proposed, together with a Markov-chain-based estimation method for it.'

- abstract: 'With the development of hardware accelerators and their corresponding
    tools,

    evaluations have become more affordable through fast and massively parallel

    evaluations in some applications. This advancement has drastically sped up the

    runtime of evolution-inspired algorithms such as Quality-Diversity

    optimization, creating tremendous potential for algorithmic innovation through

    scale. In this work, we propose MAP-Elites-Multi-ES (MEMES), a novel QD

    algorithm based on Evolution Strategies (ES) designed for fast parallel

    evaluations. ME-Multi-ES builds on top of the existing MAP-Elites-ES algorithm,

    scaling it by maintaining multiple independent ES threads with massive

    parallelization. We also introduce a new dynamic reset procedure for the

    lifespan of the independent ES to autonomously maximize the improvement of the

    QD population. We show experimentally that MEMES outperforms existing

    gradient-based and objective-agnostic QD algorithms when compared in terms of

    generations. We perform this comparison on both black-box optimization and

    QD-Reinforcement Learning tasks, demonstrating the benefit of our approach

    across different problems and domains. Finally, we also find that our approach

    intrinsically enables optimization of fitness locally around a niche, a

    phenomenon not observed in other QD algorithms.'

- abstract: 'As human-robot interaction (HRI) systems advance, so does the difficulty
    of

    evaluating and understanding the strengths and limitations of these systems in

    different environments and with different users. To this end, previous methods

    have algorithmically generated diverse scenarios that reveal system failures in

    a shared control teleoperation task. However, these methods require directly

    evaluating generated scenarios by simulating robot policies and human actions.

    The computational cost of these evaluations limits their applicability in more

    complex domains. Thus, we propose augmenting scenario generation systems with

    surrogate models that predict both human and robot behaviors. In the shared

    control teleoperation domain and a more complex shared workspace collaboration

    task, we show that surrogate assisted scenario generation efficiently

    synthesizes diverse datasets of challenging scenarios. We demonstrate that

    these failures are reproducible in real-world interactions.'

- abstract: 'Quality diversity algorithms can be used to efficiently create a diverse
    set

    of solutions to inform engineers'' intuition. But quality diversity is not

    efficient in very expensive problems, needing 100.000s of evaluations. Even

    with the assistance of surrogate models, quality diversity needs 100s or even

    1000s of evaluations, which can make it use infeasible. In this study we try to

    tackle this problem by using a pre-optimization strategy on a lower-dimensional

    optimization problem and then map the solutions to a higher-dimensional case.

    For a use case to design buildings that minimize wind nuisance, we show that we

    can predict flow features around 3D buildings from 2D flow features around

    building footprints. For a diverse set of building designs, by sampling the

    space of 2D footprints with a quality diversity algorithm, a predictive model

    can be trained that is more accurate than when trained on a set of footprints

    that were selected with a space-filling algorithm like the Sobol sequence.

    Simulating only 16 buildings in 3D, a set of 1024 building designs with low

    predicted wind nuisance is created. We show that we can produce better machine

    learning models by producing training data with quality diversity instead of

    using common sampling techniques. The method can bootstrap generative design in

    a computationally expensive 3D domain and allow engineers to sweep the design

    space, understanding wind nuisance in early design phases.'

  year: 2022

- abstract: 'Quality Diversity (QD) has emerged as a powerful alternative optimization

    paradigm that aims at generating large and diverse collections of solutions,

    notably with its flagship algorithm MAP-ELITES (ME) which evolves solutions

    through mutations and crossovers. While very effective for some unstructured

    problems, early ME implementations relied exclusively on random search to

    evolve the population of solutions, rendering them notoriously

    sample-inefficient for high-dimensional problems, such as when evolving neural

    networks. Follow-up works considered exploiting gradient information to guide

    the search in order to address these shortcomings through techniques borrowed

    from either Black-Box Optimization (BBO) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). While

    mixing RL techniques with ME unlocked state-of-the-art performance for robotics

    control problems that require a good amount of exploration, it also plagued

    these ME variants with limitations common among RL algorithms that ME was free

    of, such as hyperparameter sensitivity, high stochasticity as well as training

    instability, including when the population size increases as some components

    are shared across the population in recent approaches. Furthermore, existing

    approaches mixing ME with RL tend to be tied to a specific RL algorithm, which

    effectively prevents their use on problems where the corresponding RL algorithm

    fails. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a flexible framework that

    allows the use of any RL algorithm and alleviates the aforementioned

    limitations by evolving populations of agents (whose definition include

    hyperparameters and all learnable parameters) instead of just policies. We

    demonstrate the benefits brought about by our framework through extensive

    numerical experiments on a number of robotics control problems, some of which

    with deceptive rewards, taken from the QD-RL literature.'

- abstract: 'Quality-Diversity optimisation (QD) has proven to yield promising results

    across a broad set of applications. However, QD approaches struggle in the

    presence of uncertainty in the environment, as it impacts their ability to

    quantify the true performance and novelty of solutions. This problem has been

    highlighted multiple times independently in previous literature. In this work,

    we propose to uniformise the view on this problem through four main

    contributions. First, we formalise a common framework for uncertain domains:

    the Uncertain QD setting, a special case of QD in which fitness and descriptors

    for each solution are no longer fixed values but distribution over possible

    values. Second, we propose a new methodology to evaluate Uncertain QD

    approaches, relying on a new per-generation sampling budget and a set of

    existing and new metrics specifically designed for Uncertain QD. Third, we

    propose three new Uncertain QD algorithms: Archive-sampling,

    Parallel-Adaptive-sampling and Deep-Grid-sampling. We propose these approaches

    taking into account recent advances in the QD community toward the use of

    hardware acceleration that enable large numbers of parallel evaluations and

    make sampling an affordable approach to uncertainty. Our final and fourth

    contribution is to use this new framework and the associated comparison methods

    to benchmark existing and novel approaches. We demonstrate once again the

    limitation of MAP-Elites in uncertain domains and highlight the performance of

    the existing Deep-Grid approach, and of our new algorithms. The goal of this

    framework and methods is to become an instrumental benchmark for future works

    considering Uncertain QD.'

- abstract: 'Quality-Diversity algorithms, among which MAP-Elites, have emerged as

    powerful alternatives to performance-only optimisation approaches as they

    enable generating collections of diverse and high-performing solutions to an

    optimisation problem. However, they are often limited to low-dimensional search

    spaces and deterministic environments. The recently introduced Policy Gradient

    Assisted MAP-Elites (PGA-MAP-Elites) algorithm overcomes this limitation by

    pairing the traditional Genetic operator of MAP-Elites with a gradient-based

    operator inspired by Deep Reinforcement Learning. This new operator guides

    mutations toward high-performing solutions using policy-gradients. In this

    work, we propose an in-depth study of PGA-MAP-Elites. We demonstrate the

    benefits of policy-gradients on the performance of the algorithm and the

    reproducibility of the generated solutions when considering uncertain domains.

    We first prove that PGA-MAP-Elites is highly performant in both deterministic

    and uncertain high-dimensional environments, decorrelating the two challenges

    it tackles. Secondly, we show that in addition to outperforming all the

    considered baselines, the collections of solutions generated by PGA-MAP-Elites

    are highly reproducible in uncertain environments, approaching the

    reproducibility of solutions found by Quality-Diversity approaches built

    specifically for uncertain applications. Finally, we propose an ablation and

    in-depth analysis of the dynamic of the policy-gradients-based variation. We

    demonstrate that the policy-gradient variation operator is determinant to

    guarantee the performance of PGA-MAP-Elites but is only essential during the

    early stage of the process, where it finds high-performing regions of the

    search space.'

- abstract: 'A prevalent limitation of optimizing over a single objective is that
    it can

    be misguided, becoming trapped in local optimum. This can be rectified by

    Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, where a population of high-quality and

    diverse solutions to a problem is preferred. Most conventional QD approaches,

    for example, MAP-Elites, explicitly manage a behavioral archive where solutions

    are broken down into predefined niches. In this work, we show that a diverse

    population of solutions can be found without the limitation of needing an

    archive or defining the range of behaviors in advance. Instead, we break down

    solutions into independently evolving species and use unsupervised skill

    discovery to learn diverse, high-performing solutions. We show that this can be

    done through gradient-based mutations that take on an information theoretic

    perspective of jointly maximizing mutual information and performance. We

    propose Diverse Quality Species (DQS) as an alternative to archive-based QD

    algorithms. We evaluate it over several simulated robotic environments and show

    that it can learn a diverse set of solutions from varying species. Furthermore,

    our results show that DQS is more sample-efficient and performant when compared

    to other QD algorithms. Relevant code and hyper-parameters are available at:

- abstract: 'This paper introduces a user-driven evolutionary algorithm based on Quality

    Diversity (QD) search. During a design session, the user iteratively selects

    among presented alternatives and their selections affect the upcoming results.

    We aim to address two major concerns of interactive evolution: (a) the user

    must be presented with few alternatives, to reduce cognitive load; (b)

    presented alternatives should be diverse but similar to the previous user

    selection, to reduce user fatigue. To address these concerns, we implement a

    variation of the MAP-Elites algorithm where the presented alternatives are

    sampled from a small region (window) of the behavioral space. After a user

    selection, the window is centered on the selected individual''s behavior

    characterization, evolution selects parents from within this window to produce

    offspring, and new alternatives are sampled. Essentially we define an adaptive

    system of local QD, where the user''s selections guide the search towards

    specific regions of the behavioral space. The system is tested on the

    generation of architectural layouts, a constrained optimization task,

    leveraging QD through a two-archive approach. Results show that while global

    exploration is not as pronounced as in MAP-Elites, the system finds more

    appropriate solutions to the user''s taste, based on experiments with

    controllable artificial users.'

  title: Fast generation of centroids for MAP-Elites
  year: 2023

- abstract: 'Quality diversity~(QD) is a branch of evolutionary computation that gained

    increasing interest in recent years. The Map-Elites QD approach defines a

    feature space, i.e., a partition of the search space, and stores the best

    solution for each cell of this space. We study a simple QD algorithm in the

    context of pseudo-Boolean optimisation on the ``number of ones'''' feature space,

    where the $i$th cell stores the best solution amongst those with a number of

    ones in $[(i-1)k, ik-1]$. Here $k$ is a granularity parameter $1 \leq k \leq

    n+1$. We give a tight bound on the expected time until all cells are covered

    for arbitrary fitness functions and for all $k$ and analyse the expected

    optimisation time of QD on \textsc{OneMax} and other problems whose structure

    aligns favourably with the feature space. On combinatorial problems we show

    that QD finds a ${(1-1/e)}$-approximation when maximising any monotone

    sub-modular function with a single uniform cardinality constraint efficiently.

    Defining the feature space as the number of connected components of a connected

    graph, we show that QD finds a minimum spanning tree in expected polynomial

    time.'

- abstract: 'The representation, or encoding, utilized in evolutionary algorithms
    has a

    substantial effect on their performance. Examination of the suitability of

    widely used representations for quality diversity optimization (QD) in robotic

    domains has yielded inconsistent results regarding the most appropriate

    encoding method. Given the domain-dependent nature of QD, additional evidence

    from other domains is necessary. This study compares the impact of several

    representations, including direct encoding, a dictionary-based representation,

    parametric encoding, compositional pattern producing networks, and cellular

    automata, on the generation of voxelized meshes in an architecture setting. The

    results reveal that some indirect encodings outperform direct encodings and can

    generate more diverse solution sets, especially when considering full

    phenotypic diversity. The paper introduces a multi-encoding QD approach that

    incorporates all evaluated representations in the same archive. Species of

    encodings compete on the basis of phenotypic features, leading to an approach

    that demonstrates similar performance to the best single-encoding QD approach.

    This is noteworthy, as it does not always require the contribution of the

    best-performing single encoding.'

- abstract: 'The synergies between Quality-Diversity (QD) and Deep Reinforcement Learning

    (RL) have led to powerful hybrid QD-RL algorithms that have shown tremendous

    potential, and brings the best of both fields. However, only a single deep RL

    algorithm (TD3) has been used in prior hybrid methods despite notable progress

    made by other RL algorithms. Additionally, there are fundamental differences in

    the optimization procedures between QD and RL which would benefit from a more

    principled approach. We propose Generalized Actor-Critic QD-RL, a unified

    modular framework for actor-critic deep RL methods in the QD-RL setting. This

    framework provides a path to study insights from Deep RL in the QD-RL setting,

    which is an important and efficient way to make progress in QD-RL. We introduce

    two new algorithms, PGA-ME (SAC) and PGA-ME (DroQ) which apply recent

    advancements in Deep RL to the QD-RL setting, and solves the humanoid

    environment which was not possible using existing QD-RL algorithms. However, we

    also find that not all insights from Deep RL can be effectively translated to

    QD-RL. Critically, this work also demonstrates that the actor-critic models in

    QD-RL are generally insufficiently trained and performance gains can be

    achieved without any additional environment evaluations.'

- abstract: 'Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms are designed to generate collections
    of

    high-performing solutions while maximizing their diversity in a given

    descriptor space. However, in the presence of unpredictable noise, the fitness

    and descriptor of the same solution can differ significantly from one

    evaluation to another, leading to uncertainty in the estimation of such values.

    Given the elitist nature of QD algorithms, they commonly end up with many

    degenerate solutions in such noisy settings. In this work, we introduce Archive

    Reproducibility Improvement Algorithm (ARIA); a plug-and-play approach that

    improves the reproducibility of the solutions present in an archive. We propose

    it as a separate optimization module, relying on natural evolution strategies,

    that can be executed on top of any QD algorithm. Our module mutates solutions

    to (1) optimize their probability of belonging to their niche, and (2) maximize

    their fitness. The performance of our method is evaluated on various tasks,

    including a classical optimization problem and two high-dimensional control

    tasks in simulated robotic environments. We show that our algorithm enhances

    the quality and descriptor space coverage of any given archive by at least 50%.'

- abstract: 'Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have recently gained traction as

    optimisation methods due to their effectiveness at escaping local optima and

    capability of generating wide-ranging and high-performing solutions. Recently,

    Multi-Objective MAP-Elites (MOME) extended the QD paradigm to the

    multi-objective setting by maintaining a Pareto front in each cell of a

    map-elites grid. MOME achieved a global performance that competed with NSGA-II

    and SPEA2, two well-established Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEA),

    while also acquiring a diverse repertoire of solutions. However, MOME is

    limited by non-directed genetic search mechanisms which struggle in

    high-dimensional search spaces. In this work, we present Multi-Objective

    MAP-Elites with Policy-Gradient Assistance and Crowding-based Exploration

    (MOME-PGX): a new QD algorithm that extends MOME to improve its data efficiency

    and performance. MOME-PGX uses gradient-based optimisation to efficiently drive

    solutions towards higher performance. It also introduces crowding-based

    mechanisms to create an improved exploration strategy and to encourage

    uniformity across Pareto fronts. We evaluate MOME-PGX in four simulated robot

    locomotion tasks and demonstrate that it converges faster and to a higher

    performance than all other baselines. We show that MOME-PGX is between 4.3 and

    42 times more data-efficient than MOME and doubles the performance of MOME,

- abstract: 'Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms have been proposed to search for a
    large

    collection of both diverse and high-performing solutions instead of a single

    set of local optima. While early QD algorithms view the objective and

    descriptor functions as black-box functions, novel tools have been introduced

    to use gradient information to accelerate the search and improve overall

    performance of those algorithms over continuous input spaces. However a broad

    range of applications involve discrete spaces, such as drug discovery or image

    generation. Exploring those spaces is challenging as they are combinatorially

    large and gradients cannot be used in the same manner as in continuous spaces.

    We introduce map-elites with a Gradient-Informed Discrete Emitter (ME-GIDE),

    which extends QD optimisation with differentiable functions over discrete

    search spaces. ME-GIDE leverages the gradient information of the objective and

    descriptor functions with respect to its discrete inputs to propose

    gradient-informed updates that guide the search towards a diverse set of high

    quality solutions. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks including

    protein design and discrete latent space illumination and find that our method

  abstract: "This paper proposes a novel meta-learning approach to optimize a robust portfolio ensemble. The method uses a deep generative model to generate diverse and high-quality sub-portfolios combined to form the ensemble portfolio.

During training, the model takes a randomly sampled batch of Gaussian noise and outputs a population of solutions, which are then evaluated using the objective function of the problem. The weights of the model are updated using a gradient-based optimizer. The convolutional layer transforms the noise into a desired distribution in latent space, while the LSTM module adds dependence between generations. The dense network decodes the population of solutions. The proposed method balances maximizing the performance of the sub-portfolios with minimizing their maximum correlation, resulting in a robust ensemble portfolio against systematic shocks. The approach was effective in experiments where stochastic rewards were present. Moreover, the results (Fig. 1) demonstrated that the ensemble portfolio obtained by taking the average of the generated sub-portfolio weights was robust and generalized well.

  abstract: "When using Quality Diversity (QD) optimization to solve hard exploration or deceptive search problems, we assume that diversity is extrinsically valuable. This means that diversity is important to help us reach an objective, but is not an objective in itself. Often, in these domains, practitioners benchmark their QD algorithms against single objective optimization frameworks. In this paper, we argue that the correct comparison should be made to \emphmulti-objective optimization frameworks. This is because single objective optimization frameworks rely on the aggregation of sub-objectives, which could result in decreased information that is crucial for maintaining diverse populations automatically. In order to facilitate a fair comparison between quality diversity and multi-objective optimization, we present a method that utilizes dimensionality reduction to automatically determine a set of behavioral descriptors for an individual, as well as a set of objectives for an individual to solve. Using the former, one can generate solutions using standard quality diversity optimization techniques, and using the latter, one can generate solutions using standard multi-objective optimization techniques. This allows for a level comparison between these two classes of algorithms, without requiring domain and algorithm specific modifications to facilitate a comparison."

  abstract: "Minecraft is a great testbed for human creativity that has inspired the design of various structures and even functioning machines, including flying machines. EvoCraft is an API for programmatically generating structures in Minecraft, but the initial work in this domain was not capable of evolving flying machines. This paper applies fitness-based evolution and quality diversity search in order to evolve flying machines. Although fitness alone can occasionally produce flying machines, thanks in part to a more sophisticated fitness function than was used previously, the quality diversity algorithm MAP-Elites is capable of discovering flying machines much more reliably, at least when an appropriate behavior characterization is used to guide the search for diverse solutions."

  abstract: "Mobile soft robots offer compelling applications in fields ranging from urban search and rescue to planetary exploration. A critical challenge of soft robotic control is that the nonlinear dynamics imposed by soft materials often result in complex behaviors that are counter-intuitive and hard to model or predict. As a consequence, most behaviors for mobile soft robots are discovered through empirical trial and error and handtuning. A second challenge is that soft materials are difficult to simulate with high fidelity - leading to a significant reality gap when trying to discover or optimize new behaviors. In this work we employ a Quality Diversity Algorithm running model-free on a physical soft tensegrity robot that autonomously generates a behavioral repertoire with no a priori knowledge of the robot’s dynamics, and minimal human intervention. The resulting behavior repertoire displays a diversity of unique locomotive gaits useful for a variety of tasks. These results help provide a road map for increasing the behavioral capabilities of mobile soft robots through real-world automation."

  abstract: "In evolutionary computation, the fitness function normally measures progress towards an objective in the search space, effectively acting as an objective function. Through deception, such objective functions may actually prevent the objective from being reached. While methods exist to mitigate deception, they leave the underlying pathology untreated: Objective functions themselves may actively misdirect search towards dead ends. This paper proposes an approach to circumventing deception that also yields a new perspective on open-ended evolution: Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling natural evolution to capture open-endedness, the idea is to simply search for behavioral novelty. Even in an objective-based problem, such novelty search ignores the objective. Because many points in the search space collapse to a single behavior, the search for novelty is often feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behaviors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. By decoupling open-ended search from artificial life worlds, the search for novelty is applicable to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the maze navigation and biped walking tasks in this paper, novelty search significantly outperforms objective-based search, suggesting the strange conclusion that some problems are best solved by methods that ignore the objective. The main lesson is the inherent limitation of the objective-based paradigm and the unexploited opportunity to guide search through other means."

  abstract: "An ambitious challenge in artificial life is to craft an evolutionary process that discovers a wide diversity of welladapted virtual creatures within a single run. Unlike in nature, evolving creatures in virtual worlds tend to converge to a single morphology because selection therein greedily rewards the morphology that is easiest to exploit. However, novelty search, a technique that explicitly rewards diverging, can potentially mitigate such convergence. Thus in this paper an existing creature evolution platform is extended with multi-objective search that balances drives for both novelty and performance. However, there are different ways to combine performance-driven search and novelty search. The suggested approach is to provide evolution with both a novelty objective that encourages diverse morphologies and a local competition objective that rewards individuals outperforming those most similar in morphology. The results in an experiment evolving locomoting virtual creatures show that novelty search with local competition discovers more functional morphological diversity within a single run than models with global competition, which are more predisposed to converge. The conclusions are that novelty search with local competition may complement recent advances in evolving virtual creatures and may in general be a principled approach to combining novelty search with pressure to achieve."

  abstract: "While evolutionary computation and evolutionary robotics take inspiration from nature, they have long focused mainly on problems of performance optimization. Yet, evolution in nature can be interpreted as more nuanced than a process of simple optimization. In particular, natural evolution is a divergent search that optimizes locally within each niche as it simultaneously diversifies. This tendency to discover both quality and diversity at the same time differs from many of the conventional algorithms of machine learning, and also thereby suggests a different foundation for inferring the approach of greatest potential for evolutionary algorithms. In fact, several recent evolutionary algorithms called quality diversity (QD) algorithms (e.g., novelty search with local competition and MAP-Elites) have drawn inspiration from this more nuanced view, aiming to fill a space of possibilities with the best possible example of each type of achievable behavior. The result is a new class of algorithms that return an archive of diverse, high-quality behaviors in a single run. The aim in this paper is to study the application of QD algorithms in challenging environments (in particular complex mazes) to establish their best practices for ambitious domains in the future. In addition to providing insight into cases when QD succeeds and fails, a new approach is investigated that hybridizes multiple views of behaviors (called behavior characterizations) in the same run, which succeeds in overcoming some of the challenges associated with searching for QD with respect to a behavior characterization that is not necessarily sufficient for generating both quality and diversity at the same time."

  abstract: "Many fields use search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space to find high-performing solutions: chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs; engineers search for stronger, cheaper, safer designs, scientists search for models that best explain data, etc. The goal of search algorithms has traditionally been to return the single highest-performing solution in a search space. Here we describe a new, fundamentally different type of algorithm that is more useful because it provides a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed throughout a search space. It creates a map of high-performing solutions at each point in a space defined by dimensions of variation that a user gets to choose. This Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites) algorithm illuminates search spaces, allowing researchers to understand how interesting attributes of solutions combine to affect performance, either positively or, equally of interest, negatively. For example, a drug company may wish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their cost-to-produce vary. MAP-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different solutions, which can be more helpful than a single, high-performing solution. Interestingly, because MAP-Elites explores more of the search space, it also tends to find a better overall solution than state-of-the-art search algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of this new algorithm in three different problem domains ranging from producing modular neural networks to designing simulated and real soft robots. Because MAP- Elites (1) illuminates the relationship between performance and dimensions of interest in solutions, (2) returns a set of high-performing, yet diverse solutions, and (3) improves finding a single, best solution, it will advance science and engineering."

  abstract: "As robots leave the controlled environments of factories to autonomously function in more complex, natural environments, they will have to respond to the inevitable fact that they will become damaged. However, while animals can quickly adapt to a wide variety of injuries, current robots cannot \"think outside the box\" to find a compensatory behavior when damaged: they are limited to their pre-specified self-sensing abilities, can diagnose only anticipated failure modes, and require a pre-programmed contingency plan for every type of potential damage, an impracticality for complex robots. Here we introduce an intelligent trial and error algorithm that allows robots to adapt to damage in less than two minutes, without requiring self-diagnosis or pre-specified contingency plans. Before deployment, a robot exploits a novel algorithm to create a detailed map of the space of high-performing behaviors: This map represents the robot's intuitions about what behaviors it can perform and their value. If the robot is damaged, it uses these intuitions to guide a trial-and-error learning algorithm that conducts intelligent experiments to rapidly discover a compensatory behavior that works in spite of the damage. Experiments reveal successful adaptations for a legged robot injured in five different ways, including damaged, broken, and missing legs, and for a robotic arm with joints broken in 14 different ways. This new technique will enable more robust, effective, autonomous robots, and suggests principles that animals may use to adapt to injury."

  abstract: "The recently introduced Intelligent Trial and Error algorithm (IT&E) both improves the ability to automatically generate controllers that transfer to real robots, and enables robots to creatively adapt to damage in less than 2 minutes. A key component of IT&E is a new evolutionary algorithm called MAP-Elites, which creates a behavior-performance map that is provided as a set of \" creative \" ideas to an online learning algorithm. To date, all experiments with MAP-Elites have been performed with a directly encoded list of parameters: it is therefore unknown how MAP-Elites would behave with more advanced encodings, like HyperNeat and SUPG. In addition, because we ultimately want robots that respond to their environments via sensors, we investigate the ability of MAP-Elites to evolve closed-loop controllers, which are more complicated, but also more powerful. Our results show that the encoding critically impacts the quality of the results of MAP-Elites, and that the differences are likely linked to the locality of the encoding (the likelihood of generating a similar behavior after a single mutation). Overall, these results improve our understanding of both the dynamics of the MAP-Elites algorithm and how to best harness MAP-Elites to evolve effective and adaptable robotic controllers."

  abstract: "In contrast to the conventional role of evolution in evolution-ary computation (EC) as an optimization algorithm, a newclass of evolutionary algorithms has emerged in recent yearsthat instead aim to accumulate as diverse a collection of dis-coveries as possible, yet where each variant in the collection isas fit as it can be. Often applied in both neuroevolution andmorphological evolution, these newquality diversity(QD)algorithms are particularly well-suited to evolution’s inherentstrengths, thereby offering a promising niche for EC withinthe broader field of machine learning. However, because QDalgorithms are so new, until now no comprehensive studyhas yet attempted to systematically elucidate their relativestrengths and weaknesses under different conditions. Tak-ing a first step in this direction, this paper introduces anew benchmark domain designed specifically to compare andcontrast QD algorithms. It then shows how the degree ofalignment between the measure of quality and the behaviorcharacterization (which is an essential component of all QDalgorithms to date) impacts the ultimate performance ofdifferent such algorithms. The hope is that this initial studywill help to stimulate interest in QD and begin to unify thedisparate ideas in the area."

  abstract: "Learning in robotics typically involves choosing a simple goal(e.g. walking) and assessing the performance of each con-troller with regard to this task (e.g. walking speed). How-ever, learning advanced, input-driven controllers (e.g. walk-ing in each direction) requires testing each controller on a large sample of the possible input signals. This costly pro-cess makes difficult to learn useful low-level controllers in robotics. Here we introduce BR-Evolution, a new evolutionary learn-ing technique that generates a behavioral repertoire by taking advantage of the candidate solutions that are usually discarded. Instead of evolving a single, general controller,BR-evolution thus evolves a collection of simple controllers, one for each variant of the target behavior; to distinguish similar controllers, it uses a performance objective that al-lows it to produce a collection of diverse but high-performing behaviors. We evaluated this new technique by evolving gait controllers for a simulated hexapod robot. Results show that a single run of the EA quickly finds a collection of controllers that allows the robot to reach each point of the reachable space. Overall, BR-Evolution opens a new kind of learning algorithm that simultaneously optimizes all the achievable behaviors of a robot."

  abstract: "Numerous algorithms have been proposed to allow legged robots to learn to walk. However, the vast majority of these algorithms is devised to learn to walk in a straight line, which is not sufficient to accomplish any real-world mission. Here we introduce the Transferability-based Behavioral Repertoire Evolution algorithm (TBR-Evolution), a novel evolutionary algorithm that simultaneously discovers several hundreds of simple walking controllers, one for each possible direction. By taking advantage of solutions that are usually discarded by evolutionary processes, TBR-Evolution is substantially faster than independently evolving each controller. Our technique relies on two methods: (1) novelty search with local competition, which searches for both high-performing and diverse solutions, and (2) the transferability approach, which com-bines simulations and real tests to evolve controllers for a physical robot. We evaluate this new technique on a hexapod robot. Results show that with only a few dozen short experiments performed on the robot, the algorithm learns a repertoire of con-trollers that allows the robot to reach every point in its reachable space. Overall, TBR-Evolution opens a new kind of learning algorithm that simultaneously optimizes all the achievable behaviors of a robot."

  abstract: "The recently introduced Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites) is an evolutionary algorithm capable of producing a large archive of diverse, high-performing solutions in a single run. It works by discretizing a continuous feature space into unique regions according to the desired discretization per dimension. While simple, this algorithm has a main drawback: it cannot scale to high-dimensional feature spaces since the number of regions increase exponentially with the number of dimensions. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing a simple extension of MAP-Elites that has a constant, pre-defined number of regions irrespective of the dimensionality of the feature space. Our main insight is that methods from computational geometry could partition a high-dimensional space into well-spread geometric regions. In particular, our algorithm uses a centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) to divide the feature space into a desired number of regions; it then places every generated individual in its closest region, replacing a less fit one if the region is already occupied. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new \" CVT-MAP-Elites \" algorithm in high-dimensional feature spaces through comparisons against MAP-Elites in maze navigation and hexapod locomotion tasks."

In these domains illumination algorithms, such as MAP-Elites, are promising alternatives to classic optimization algorithms because they produce diverse, high-quality solutions in a single run, instead of only a single near-optimal solution.

In this article we introduce a new illumination algorithm, Surrogate-Assisted Illumination (SAIL), that leverages surrogate modeling techniques to create a map of the design space according to user-defined features while minimizing the number of fitness evaluations. On a 2-dimensional airfoil optimization problem SAIL produces hundreds of diverse but high-performing designs with several orders of magnitude fewer evaluations than MAP-Elites or CMA-ES. We demonstrate that SAIL is also capable of producing maps of high-performing designs in realistic 3-dimensional aerodynamic tasks with an accurate flow simulation. Data-efficient design exploration with SAIL can help designers understand what is possible, beyond what is optimal, by considering more than pure objective-based optimization."

  abstract: "Evolution has produced an astonishing diversity of species, each filling a different niche. Algorithms like MAP-Elites mimic this divergent evolutionary process to find a set of behaviorally diverse but high-performing solutions, called the elites. Our key insight is that species in nature often share a surprisingly large part of their genome, in spite of occupying very different niches; similarly, the elites are likely to be concentrated in a specific \"elite hypervolume\" whose shape is defined by their common features. In this paper, we first introduce the elite hypervolume concept and propose two metrics to characterize it: the genotypic spread and the genotypic similarity. We then introduce a new variation operator, called \"directional variation\", that exploits interspecies (or inter-elites) correlations to accelerate the MAP-Elites algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this operator in three problems (a toy function, a redundant robotic arm, and a hexapod robot)"

  abstract: "Biological evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations, often surprising the scientists who discover them. However, because evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs, evolution's creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution have observed their evolving algorithms and organisms subverting their intentions, exposing unrecognized bugs in their code, producing unexpected adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely reveal creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems."

The Surrogate-Assisted Illumination (SAIL) algorithm, introduced here, integrates approximative models and intelligent sampling of the objective function to minimize the number of evaluations required by MAP-Elites. The ability of SAIL to efficiently produce both accurate models and diverse high-performing solutions is illustrated on a 2D airfoil design problem. The search space is divided into bins, each holding a design with a diierent combination of features. In each bin SAIL produces a better performing solution than MAP-Elites, and requires several orders of magnitude fewer evaluations. The CMA-ES algorithm was used to produce an optimal design in each bin: with the same number of evaluations required by CMA-ES to find a near-optimal solution in a single bin, SAIL finds solutions of similar quality in every bin."

The success of this algorithm relies on two components: prior knowledge acquired through simulation with an intact robot, and Bayesian optimization (BO) that operates on-line, on the damaged robot. While IT&E leads to fast damage recovery, it does not incorporate any safety constraints that prevent the robot from attempting harmful behaviors. In this work, we address this limitation by replacing the BO component with a constrained BO procedure. We evaluate our approach on a simulated damaged humanoid robot that needs to crawl as fast as possible, while performing as few unsafe trials as possible. We compare our new \"safety-aware IT&E\" algorithm to IT&E and a multi-objective version of IT&E in which the safety constraints are dealt as separate objectives. Our results show that our algorithm outperforms the other approaches, both in crawling speed within the safe regions and number of unsafe trials."

  abstract: "The optimization of functions to find the best solution according to one or several objectives has a central role in many engineering and research fields. Recently, a new family of optimization algorithms, named Quality-Diversity optimization, has been introduced, and contrasts with classic algorithms. Instead of searching for a single solution, Quality-Diversity algorithms are searching for a large collection of both diverse and high-performing solutions. The role of this collection is to cover the range of possible solution types as much as possible, and to contain the best solution for each type. The contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we present a unifying framework of Quality-Diversity optimization algorithms that covers the two main algorithms of this family (Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites and the Novelty Search with Local Competition), and that highlights the large variety of variants that can be investigated within this family. Secondly, we propose algorithms with a new selection mechanism for Quality-Diversity algorithms that outperforms all the algorithms tested in this paper. Lastly, we present a new collection management that overcomes the erosion issues observed when using unstructured collections. These three contributions are supported by extensive experimental comparisons of Quality-Diversity algorithms on three different experimental scenarios."

  abstract: "Enabling artificial agents to automatically learn complex, versatile and high-performing behaviors is a long-lasting challenge. This paper presents a step in this direction with hierarchical behavioral repertoires that stack several behavioral repertoires to generate sophisticated behaviors. Each repertoire of this architecture uses the lower repertoires to create complex behaviors as sequences of simpler ones, while only the lowest repertoire directly controls the agent's movements. This paper also introduces a novel approach to automatically define behavioral descriptors thanks to an unsupervised neural network that organizes the produced high-level behaviors. The experiments show that the proposed architecture enables a robot to learn how to draw digits in an unsupervised manner after having learned to draw lines and arcs. Compared to traditional behavioral repertoires, the proposed architecture reduces the dimensionality of the optimization problems by orders of magnitude and provides behaviors with a twice better fitness. More importantly, it enables the transfer of knowledge between robots: a hierarchical repertoire evolved for a robotic arm to draw digits can be transferred to a humanoid robot by simply changing the lowest layer of the hierarchy. This enables the humanoid to draw digits although it has never been trained for this task."

Evolving group diversity however has proved challenging within Evolutionary Robotics, requiring reproductive isolation and careful attention to population size and selection mechanisms. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel, decentralised, variant of the MAP-Elites illumination algorithm which is hybridised with a well-known distributed evolutionary algorithm (mEDEA). The algorithm simultaneously evolves multiple diverse behaviours for multiple robots, with respect to a simple token-gathering task. Each robot in the swarm maintains a local archive defined by two pre-specified functional traits which is shared with robots it come into contact with. We investigate four different strategies for sharing, exploiting and combining local archives and compare results to mEDEA. Experimental results show that in contrast to previous claims, it is possible to evolve a functionally diverse swarm without geographical isolation, and that the new method outperforms mEDEA in terms of the diversity, coverage and precision of the evolved swarm."

In QD, diversity of behaviors or phenotypes is defined by a behavior characterization (BC) that is typically unaligned with (i.e.orthogonal to) the notion of quality. As experiments in a difficult maze task reinforce, QD algorithms driven by such an unaligned BC are unable to discover the best solutions on sufficiently deceptive problems. This study comprehensively surveys known QD algorithms and introduces several novel variants thereof, including a method for successfully confronting deceptive QD landscapes: driving search with multiple BCs simultaneously."

  abstract: "An important challenge in reinforcement learning, including evolutionary robotics, is to solve multimodal problems, where agents have to act in qualitatively different ways depending on the circumstances. Because multimodal problems are often too difficult to solve directly, it is helpful to take advantage of staging, where a difficult task is divided into simpler subtasks that can serve as stepping stones for solving the overall problem. Unfortunately, choosing an effective ordering for these subtasks is difficult, and a poor ordering can reduce the speed and performance of the learning process. Here, we provide a thorough introduction and investigation of the Combinatorial Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (CMOEA), which avoids ordering subtasks by allowing all combinations of subtasks to be explored simultaneously. We compare CMOEA against two algorithms that can similarly optimize on multiple subtasks simultaneously: NSGA-II and Lexicase Selection. The algorithms are tested on a multimodal robotics problem with six subtasks as well as a maze navigation problem with a hundred subtasks. On these problems, CMOEA either outperforms or is competitive with the controls. Separately, we show that adding a linear combination over all objectives can improve the ability of NSGA-II to solve these multimodal problems. Lastly, we show that, in contrast to NSGA-II and Lexicase Selection, CMOEA can effectively leverage secondary objectives to achieve state-of-the-art results on the robotics task. In general, our experiments suggest that CMOEA is a promising, state-of-the-art algorithm for solving multimodal problems."

  abstract: "The Achilles Heel of stochastic optimization algorithms is etting trapped on local optima. Novelty Search avoids this problem by encouraging a search in all interesting directions.That occurs by replacing a performance objective with a reward for novel behaviors, as defined by a human-crafted, and often simple, behavioral distance function. While NoveltySearch is a major conceptual breakthrough and outperforms traditional stochastic optimization on certain problems, it is not clear how to apply it to challenging, high-dimensional problems where specifying a useful behavioral distance function is difficult. For example, in the space of images, how do you encourage novelty to produce hawks and heroes instead of endless pixel static? Here we propose a new algorithm, the Innovation Engine, that builds on Novelty Search by re-placing the human-crafted behavioral distance with a DeepNeural Network (DNN) that can recognize interesting differences between phenotypes. The key insight is that DNNs can recognize similarities and differences between phenotypes at an abstract level, wherein novelty means interesting novelty. For example, a novelty pressure in image space does not explore in the low-level pixel space, but instead creates a pressure to create new types of images (e.g. churches, mosques, obelisks, etc.). Here we describe the long-term vision for the Innovation Engine algorithm, which involves many technical challenges that remain to be solved. We then implement a simplified version of the algorithm that enables us to explore some of the algorithm’s key motivations. Our initial results, in the domain of images, suggest that Innovation Engines could ultimately automate the production of endless streams of interesting solutions in any domain: e.g.producing intelligent software, robot controllers, optimized physical components, and art."

For example, in the space of images, how doy ou encourage novelty to produce hawks and heroes instead of endless pixel static?Here we propose a new algorithm, the Innovation Engine, that builds on NoveltySearch by replacing the human-crafted behavioral distance with a Deep Neural Net-work (DNN) that can recognize interesting differences between phenotypes. The key insight is that DNNs can recognize similarities and differences between phenotypesat an abstract level, wherein novelty means interesting novelty. For example, a DNN-based novelty search in the image space does not explore in the low-level pixel space, but instead creates a pressure to create new types of images (e.g. churches, mosques, obelisks, etc.). Here we describe the long-term vision for the Innovation Engine algorithm, which involves many technical challenges that remain to be solved. We then implement a simplified version of the algorithm that enables us to explore some of the algorithm’s key motivations. Our initial results, in the domain of images, suggest that Innovation Engines could ultimately automate the production of endless streams of interesting solutions in any domain: e.g. producing intelligent software, robot con-trollers, optimized physical components, and art."

  abstract: "Extinction events impact the trajectory of biological evolution significantly. They are often viewed as upheavals to the evolutionary process. In contrast, this paper supports the hypothesis that although they are unpredictably destructive, extinction events may in the long term accelerate evolution by increasing evolvability. In particular, if extinction events extinguish indiscriminately many ways of life, indirectly they may select for the ability toe xpand rapidly through vacated niches. Lineages with such an ability are more likely to persist through multiple extinctions. Lending computational support for this hypothesis, this paper shows how increased evolvability will result from simulated extinction events in two computational models of evolved behavior. The conclusion is that although they are destructive in the short term, extinction events may make evolution more prolific in the long term."

  abstract: "An ambitious goal in evolutionary robotics (ER) is to evolve increasingly complex robotic behaviors with minimal human design effort. Reaching this goal requires evolutionary algorithms that can unlock from genetic encodings their latent potential for evolvability. One issue clouding this goal is conceptual confusion about evolvability that often obscures important or desirable aspects of evolvability. The danger from such confusion is that it may establish unrealistic goals for evolvability that prove unproductive in practice. An important issue separate from conceptual confusion is the common misalignment between selection and evolvability in ER. While more expressive encodings can represent higher-level adaptations (e.g. sexual reproduction or developmental systems) that increase long-term evolutionary potential (i.e. evolvability), realizing such potential requires gradients of fitness and evolvability to align. In other words, selection is often a critical factor limiting increasing evolvability. Thus, drawing from a series of recent papers, this article seeks to both (1) clarify and focus the ways in which the term evolvability is used within artificial evolution and (2) argue for the importance of one type of selection, i.e. divergent selection, for enabling evolvability. The main argument is that there is a fundamental connection between divergent selection and evolvability (on both the individual and population level) that does not hold for typical goal-oriented selection. The conclusion is that selection pressure plays a critical role in realizing the potential for evolvability and that divergent selection in particular provides a principled mechanism for encouraging evolvability in artificial evolution."

  abstract: "Recently there has been a growing movement of researchers that believes innovation and novelty creation, rather than pure optimization, are the true strengths of evolutionary algorithms relative to other forms of machine learning. This idea also provides one possible explanation for why evolutionary processes may exist in nervous systems on top of other forms of learning. One particularly exciting corollary of this, is that evolutionary algorithms may be used to produce what Pugh et al have dubbed Quality Diversity (QD): as many as possible different solutions (according to some characterization), which are all as fit as possible. While the notion of QD implies choosing the dimensions on which to measure diversity and performance, we propose that it may be possible (and desirable) to free the evolutionary process from requiring defining these dimensions. Toward that aim, we seek to understand more about QD in general by investigating how algorithms informed by different measures of diversity (or none at all) create QD, when that QD is mea- sured in a diversity of ways."

  abstract: "Inspired by natural evolution’s affinity for discovering a wide variety of successful organisms, a new evolutionary search paradigm has emerged wherein the goal is not to find the single best solution but rather to collect a diversity of unique phenotypes where each variant is as good as it can be. These quality diversity(QD) algorithms therefore must explore multiple promising niches simultaneously. A QD algorithm’s diversity component, formalized by specifying a behavior characterization (BC), not only generates diversity but also promotes quality by helping to overcome deception in the fitness landscape. However, some BCs (particularly those that are unaligned with the notion of quality) do not adequately mitigate deception, rendering QD algorithms unable to discover the best-performing solutions on difficult problems. This paper introduces a solution that enables QD algorithms to pursue arbitrary notions of diversity without compromising their ability to solve hard problems: driving search with multiple BCs simultaneously"

  abstract: "Quality diversity is a recent family of evolutionary search algorithms which focus on finding several well-performing (quality) yet different (diversity) solutions with the aim to maintain an appropriate balance between divergence and convergence during search. While quality diversity has already delivered promising results in complex problems, the capacity of divergent search variants for quality diversity remains largely unexplored. Inspired by the notion of surprise as an effective driver of divergent search and its orthogonal nature to novelty this paper investigates the impact of the former to quality diversity performance. For that purpose we introduce three new quality diversity algorithms which employ surprise as a diversity measure, either on its own or combined with novelty, and compare their performance against novelty search with local competition, the state of the art quality diversity algorithm. The algorithms are tested in a robot navigation task across 60 highly deceptive mazes. Our findings suggest that allowing surprise and novelty to operate synergistically for divergence and in combination with local competition leads to quality diversity algorithms of significantly higher efficiency, speed and robustness."

  abstract: "One of the most interesting features of Bayesian optimization for direct policy search is that it can leverage priors (e.g., from simulation or from previous tasks) to accelerate learning on a robot. In this paper, we are interested in situations for which several priors exist but we do not know in advance which one fits best the current situation. We tackle this problem by introducing a novel acquisition function, called Most Likely Expected Improvement (MLEI), that combines the likelihood of the priors and the expected improvement. We evaluate this new acquisition function on a transfer learning task for a 5-DOF planar arm and on a possibly damaged, 6-legged robot that has to learn to walk on flat ground and on stairs, with priors corresponding to different stairs and different kinds of damages. Our results show that MLEI effectively identifies and exploits the priors, even when there is no obvious match between the current situations and the priors. "

The search space is divided into bins, each holding a design with a different combination of features. In each bin SAIL produces a better performing solution than MAP-Elites, and requires several orders of magnitude fewer evaluations. TheCMA-ES algorithm was used to produce an optimal design in each bin: with the same number of evaluations required by CMA-ES to find a near-optimal solution in a single bin, SAIL finds solutions of similar quality in every bin."

  abstract: "One of the core functions in most Evolutionary Algorithms is mutation. In complex search spaces, which are common in Evolutionary Robotics, mutation is often used both for optimizing existing solutions, described as exploitation, and for spanning the search space, called exploration. This presents a difficult challenge for researchers as mutation parameters must be selected with care in order to balance the two, often contradictory, effects. Strategies that vary mutation during the search often try to estimate these effects in order to modify the mutation parameters. In this regard MAP-Elites, aQuality Diversity algorithm, presents an interesting opportunity. Because factors related to exploration and exploitation are readily available during the search, optimization based on these factors could be utilized to improve the search. In this paper we study how online adaptation of mutation rate, dynamic mutation, affects MAP-Elites in order to gain insightinto how the search process is affected by the mutation rate.Our study compares fixed and dynamic mutation parameters for two different complex gait controllers. The results show that dynamic mutation combines favorably with MAP-Elites and that there is a strong relation between mutation parameters and exploration that can be utilized."

  abstract: "Recent works in evolutionary robotics have shown the viability of evolution driven by behavioural novelty and diversity. These evolutionary approaches have been successfully used to generate repertoires of diverse and high-quality behaviours, instead of driving evolution towards a single, task-specific solution.Having repertoires of behaviours can enable new forms of robotic control, in which high-level controllers continually decide which behaviour to execute. To date, however, only the use of repertoires of open-loop locomotion primitives has been studied. We propose EvoRBC-II, an approach that enables the evolution of repertoires composed of general closed-loop behaviours, that can respond to the robot’s sensory inputs. The evolved repertoire is then used as a basis to evolve a transparent higher-level controller that decides when and which behaviours of the repertoire to execute. Relying on experiments in a simulated domain, we show that the evolved repertoires are composed of highly diverse and useful behaviours. The same repertoire contains sufficiently diverse behaviours to solve a wide range of tasks, and the EvoRBC-II approach can yield a performance that is comparable to the standard tabula-rasa evolution. EvoRBC-II enables automatic generation of hierarchical control through a two-step evolutionary process, thus opening doors for the further exploration of the advantages that can be brought by hierarchical control."

  abstract: "Methods that generate networks sharing a given degree distribution and global clustering can induce changes in structural properties other than that controlled for. Diversity in structural properties, in turn, can affect the outcomes of dynamical processes operating on those networks. Since exhaustive sampling is not possible, we propose a novel evolutionary framework for mapping this structural diversity. The three main features of this framework are: (a) subgraph-based encoding of networks, (b) exact mutations based on solving systems of Diophantine equations, and (c) heuristic diversity-driven mechanism to drive resolution changes in the MapElite algorithm. We show that our framework can elicit networks with diversity in their higher-order structure and that this diversity affects the behaviour of the complex contagion model. Through a comparison with state of the art clustered network generation methods, we demonstrate that our approach can uncover a comparably diverse range of networks without needing computationally unfeasible mixing times. Further, we suggest that the subgraph-based encoding provides greater confidence in the diversity of higher-order network structure for low numbers of samples and is the basis for explaining our results with complex contagion model. We believe that this framework could be applied to other complex landscapes that cannot be practically mapped via exhaustive sampling."

  abstract: "In certain complex optimization tasks, it becomes necessary to use multiple measures to characterize the performance of different algorithms. This paper presents a method that combines ordinal effect sizes with Pareto dominance to analyze such cases. Since the method is ordinal, it can also generalize across different optimization tasks even when the performance measurements are differently scaled. Through a case study, we show that this method can discover and quantify relations that would be difficult to deduce using a conventional measure-by-measure analysis. This case study applies the method to the evolution of robot controller repertoires using the MAP-Elites algorithm. Here, we analyze the search performance across a large set of parametrizations; varying mutation size and operator type, as well as map resolution, across four different robot morphologies. We show that the average magnitude of mutations has a bigger effect on outcomes than their precise distributions."

  abstract: "Workforce Scheduling and Routing Problems (WSRP) are very common in many practical domains, and usually, have a number of objectives. Illumination algorithms such as Map-Elites (ME) have recently gained traction in application to {\em design} problems, in providing multiple diverse solutions as well as illuminating the solution space in terms of user-defined characteristics, but typically require significant computational effort to produce the solution archive. We investigate whether ME can provide an effective approach to solving WSRP, a {\em repetitive} problem in which solutions have to be produced quickly and often. The goals of the paper are two-fold. The first is to evaluate whether ME can provide solutions of competitive quality to an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) in terms of a single objective function, and the second to examine its ability to provide a repertoire of solutions that maximise user choice. We find that very small computational budgets favour the EA in terms of quality, but ME outperforms the EA at larger budgets, provides a more diverse array of solutions, and lends insight to the end-user."

  abstract: "A challenge in evolutionary computation is to create representations as evolvable as those in natural evolution. This paper hypothesizes that extinction events, i.e. mass extinctions, can significantly increase evolvability, but only when combined with a divergent search algorithm, i.e. a search driven towards diversity (instead of optimality). Extinctions amplify diversity-generation by creating unpredictable evolutionary bottlenecks. Persisting through multiple such bottlenecks is more likely for lineages that diversify across many niches, resulting in indirect selection pressure for the capacity to evolve. This hypothesis is tested through experiments in two evolutionary robotics domains. The results show that combining extinction events with divergent search increases evolvability, while combining them with convergent search offers no similar benefit.

  abstract: "We describe a search-based approach to generating new levels for bullet hell games, which are action games characterized by and requiring avoidance of a very large amount of projectiles. Levels are represented using a domain-specific description language, and search in the space defined by this language is performed by a novel variant of the Map-Elites algorithm which incorporates a feasible- infeasible approach to constraint satisfaction. Simulation-based evaluation is used to gauge the fitness of levels, using an agent based on best-first search. The performance of the agent can be tuned according to the two dimensions of strategy and dexterity, making it possible to search for level configurations that require a specific combination of both. As far as we know, this paper describes the first generator for this game genre, and includes several algorithmic innovations."

  abstract: "Behavior domination is proposed as a tool for understanding and harnessing the power of evolutionary systems to discover and exploit useful stepping stones. Novelty search has shown promise in overcoming deception by collecting diverse stepping stones, and several algorithms have been proposed that combine novelty with a more traditional fitness measure to refocus search and help novelty search scale to more complex domains. However, combinations of novelty and fitness do not necessarily preserve the stepping stone discovery that novelty search affords. In several existing methods, competition between solutions can lead to an unintended loss of diversity. Behavior domination defines a class of algorithms that avoid this problem, while inheriting theoretical guarantees from multiobjective optimization. Several existing algorithms are shown to be in this class, and a new algorithm is introduced based on fast non-dominated sorting. Experimental results show that this algorithm outperforms existing approaches in domains that contain useful stepping stones, and its advantage is sustained with scale. The conclusion is that behavior domination can help illuminate the complex dynamics of behavior-driven search, and can thus lead to the design of more scalable and robust algorithms."

  abstract: "Automated design of swarm behaviors with a top-down approach is a challenging research question that has not yet been fully addressed in the robotic swarm literature. This paper seeks to explore the possibility of using an evolutionary algorithm to evolve, rather than hand code, a wide repertoire of behavior primitives enabling more effective control of a large group or swarm of unmanned systems. We use the MAP-elites algorithm to generate a repertoire of controllers with varying abilities and behaviors allowing the swarm to adapt to user-defined preferences by selection of a new appropriate controller. To test the proposed method we examine two example applications: perimeter surveillance and network creation. Perimeter surveillance require agents to explore, while network creation requires them to disperse without los-ing connectivity. These are distinct application that have drastically different requirements on agent behavior, and are a good benchmark for our swarm controller optimization framework. We show a performance com-parison between a simple weighted controller and a parametric controller.Evolving controllers allows for specifying desired behaviors top-down, in terms of objectives to solve, rather than bottom-up."

  abstract: "Four-legged mammals are capable of showing a great variety of movement patterns, ranging from a simple walk to more complex movement such as trots and gallops. Imbuing this diversity to quadruped robots is of interest in order to improve both mobility and reach. Within the field of Evolutionary Robotics, Quality Diversity techniques have shown a remarkable ability to produce not only effective, but also highly diverse solutions. When applying this approach to four-legged robots an initial problem is to create viable movement patterns that do not fall. This difficulty stems from the challenging fitness gradient due to the mammalian morphology. In this paper we propose a solution to overcome this problem by implementing incremental evolution within the QualityDiversity framework. This allows us to evolve controllers that become more complex while at the same time utilizing the diversity produced byQuality Diversity. We show that our approach is able to generate high fitness solutions early in the search process, keep these solutions and perform a more open-ended search towards the end of evolution."

  abstract: "Performing Reinforcement Learning in sparse rewards settings, with very little prior knowledge, is a challenging problem since there is no signal to properly guide the learning process. In such situations, a good search strategy is fundamental. At the same time, not having to adapt the algorithm to every single problem is very desirable. Here we introduce TAXONS, a Task Agnostic eXploration of Outcome spaces through Novelty and Surprise algorithm. Based on a population-based divergent-search approach, it learns a set of diverse policies directly from high-dimensional observations, without any task-specific information. TAXONS builds a repertoire of policies while training an autoencoder on the high-dimensional observation of the final state of the system to build a low-dimensional outcome space. The learned outcome space, combined with the reconstruction error, is used to drive the search for new policies. Results show that TAXONS can find a diverse set of controllers, covering a good part of the ground-truth outcome space, while having no information about such space."

  abstract: "During the last two decades, various models have been proposed for fish collective motion. These models are mainly developed to decipher the biological mechanisms of social interaction between animals. They consider very simple homogeneous unbounded environments and it is not clear that they can simulate accurately the collective trajectories. Moreover when the models are more accurate, the question of their scalability to either larger groups or more elaborate environments remains open. This study deals with learning how to simulate realistic collective motion of collective of zebrafish, using real-world tracking data. The objective is to devise an agent-based model that can be implemented on an artificial robotic fish that can blend into a collective of real fish. We present a novel approach that uses Quality Diversity algorithms, a class of algorithms that emphasise exploration over pure optimisation. In particular, we use CVT-MAP-Elites, a variant of the state-of-the-art MAP-Elites algorithm for high dimensional search space. Results show that Quality Diversity algorithms not only outperform classic evolutionary reinforcement learning methods at the macroscopic level (i.e. group behaviour), but are also able to generate more realistic biomimetic behaviours at the microscopic level (i.e. individual behaviour)."

  abstract: "The initial phase in real world engineering optimization and design is a process of discovery in which not all requirements can be made in advance, or are hard to formalize. Quality diversity algorithms, which produce a variety of high performing solutions, provide a unique chance to support engineers and designers in the search for what is possible and high performing. In this work we begin to answer the question how a user can interact with quality diversity and turn it into an interactive innovation aid. By modeling a user's selection it can be determined whether the optimization is drifting away from the user's preferences. The optimization is then constrained by adding a penalty to the objective function. We present an interactive quality diversity algorithm that can take into account the user's selection. The approach is evaluated in a new multimodal optimization benchmark that allows various optimization tasks to be performed. The user selection drift of the approach is compared to a state of the art alternative on both a planning and a neuroevolution control task, thereby showing its limits and possibilities."

  abstract: "Constrained optimization problems are often characterized by multiple constraints that, in the practice, must be satisfied with different tolerance levels. While some constraints are hard and as such must be satisfied with zero-tolerance, others may be soft, such that non-zero violations are acceptable. Here, we evaluate the applicability of MAP-Elites to \"illuminate\" constrained search spaces by mapping them into feature spaces where each feature corresponds to a different constraint. On the one hand, MAP-Elites implicitly preserves diversity, thus allowing a good exploration of the search space. On the other hand, it provides an effective visualization that facilitates a better understanding of how constraint violations correlate with the objective function. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on a large set of benchmark problems, in various dimensionalities, and with different algorithmic configurations. As expected, numerical results show that a basic version of MAP-Elites cannot compete on all problems (especially those with equality constraints) with state-of-the-art algorithms that use gradient information or advanced constraint handling techniques. Nevertheless, it has a higher potential at finding constraint violations vs. objectives trade-offs and providing new problem information. As such, it could be used in the future as an effective building-block for designing new constrained optimization algorithms."

  abstract: "Quality-Diversity optimization is a new family of optimization algorithms that, instead of searching for a single optimal solution to solving a task, searches for a large collection of solutions that all solve the task in a different way. This approach is particularly promising for learning behavioral repertoires in robotics, as such a diversity of behaviors enables robots to be more versatile and resilient. However, these algorithms require the user to manually define behavioral descriptors, which is used to determine whether two solutions are different or similar. The choice of a behavioral descriptor is crucial, as it completely changes the solution types that the algorithm derives. In this paper, we introduce a new method to automatically define this descriptor by combining Quality-Diversity algorithms with unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithms. This approach enables robots to autonomously discover the range of their capabilities while interacting with their environment. The results from two experimental scenarios demonstrate that robot can autonomously discover a large range of possible behaviors, without any prior knowledge about their morphology and environment. Furthermore, these behaviors are deemed to be similar to handcrafted solutions that uses domain knowledge and significantly more diverse than when using existing unsupervised methods."

  abstract: "Learning algorithms are enabling robots to solve increasingly challenging real-world tasks. These approaches often rely on demonstrations and reproduce the behavior shown. Unexpected changes in the environment may require using different behaviors to achieve the same effect, for instance to reach and grasp an object in changing clutter. An emerging paradigm addressing this robustness issue is to learn a diverse set of successful behaviors for a given task, from which a robot can select the most suitable policy when faced with a new environment. In this paper, we explore a novel realization of this vision by learning a generative model over policies. Rather than learning a single policy, or a small fixed repertoire, our generative model for policies compactly encodes an unbounded number of policies and allows novel controller variants to be sampled. Leveraging our generative policy network, a robot can sample novel behaviors until it finds one that works for a new environment. We demonstrate this idea with an application of robust ball-throwing in the presence of obstacles. We show that this approach achieves a greater diversity of behaviors than an existing evolutionary approach, while maintaining good efficacy of sampled behaviors, allowing a Baxter robot to hit targets more often when ball throwing in the presence of obstacles."

  abstract: "Reinforcement learning (RL) problems often feature deceptive local optima, and learning methods that optimize purely for reward signal often fail to learn strategies for overcoming them. Deep neuroevolution and novelty search have been proposed as effective alternatives to gradient-based methods for learning RL policies directly from pixels. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate the use of novelty search over agent action sequences by string edit metric distance as a means for promoting innovation. We also introduce a method for stagnation detection and population resampling inspired by recent developments in the RL community that uses the same mechanisms as novelty search to promote and develop innovative policies. Our methods extend a state-of-the-art method for deep neuroevolution using a simple-yet-effective genetic algorithm (GA) designed to efficiently learn deep RL policy network weights. Experiments using four games from the Atari 2600 benchmark were conducted. Results provide further evidence that GAs are competitive with gradient-based algorithms for deep RL. Results also demonstrate that novelty search over action sequences is an effective source of selection pressure that can be integrated into existing evolutionary algorithms for deep RL."

  abstract: "Swarms of molecular robots are a promising approach to create specific shapes at the microscopic scale through self-assembly. However, controlling their behavior is a challenging problem as it involves complex non-linear dynamics and high experimental variability. Hand-crafting a molecular controller will often be time-consuming and give sub-optimal results. Optimization methods, like the bioNEAT algorithm, were previously employed to partially overcome these difficulties, but they still had to cope with deceptive high-dimensional search spaces and computationally expensive simulations. Here, we describe a novel approach to solve this problem by using MAP-Elites, an algorithm that searches for both high-performing and diverse solutions. We then apply it to a molecular robotic framework we recently introduced that allows sensing, signaling and self-assembly at the micro-scale and show that MAP-Elites outperforms previous approaches. Additionally, we propose a surrogate model of micro-robots physics and chemical reaction dynamics to reduce the computational costs of simulation. We show that the resulting methodology is capable of optimizing controllers with similar accuracy as when using only a full-fledged realistic model, with half the computational budget."

  abstract: "Much of recent machine learning has focused on deep learning, in which neural network weights are trained through variants of stochastic gradient descent. An alternative approach comes from the field of neuroevolution, which harnesses evolutionary algorithms to optimize neural networks, inspired by the fact that natural brains themselves are the products of an evolutionary process. Neuroevolution enables important capabilities that are typically unavailable to gradient-based approaches, including learning neural network building blocks (for example activation functions), hyperparameters, architectures and even the algorithms for learning themselves. Neuroevolution also differs from deep learning (and deep reinforcement learning) by maintaining a population of solutions during search, enabling extreme exploration and massive parallelization. Finally, because neuroevolution research has (until recently) developed largely in isolation from gradient-based neural network research, it has developed many unique and effective techniques that should be effective in other machine learning areas too. This Review looks at several key aspects of modern neuroevolution, including large-scale computing, the benefits of novelty and diversity, the power of indirect encoding, and the field’s contributions to meta-learning and architecture search. Our hope is to inspire renewed interest in the field as it meets the potential of the increasing computation available today, to highlight how many of its ideas can provide an exciting resource for inspiration and hybridization to the deep learning, deep reinforcement learning and machine learning communities, and to explain how neuroevolution could prove to be a critical tool in the long-term pursuit of artificial general intelligence."

We propose Multi-Level Evolution (MLE), a bottom-up automatic process that designs robots across multiple levels and niches them to tasks and environmental conditions. MLE concurrently explores constituent molecular and material 'building blocks', as well as their possible assemblies into specialised morphological and sensorimotor configurations. MLE provides a route to fully harness a recent explosion in available candidate materials and ongoing advances in rapid manufacturing processes. We outline a feasible MLE architecture that realises this vision, highlight the main roadblocks and how they may be overcome, and show robotic applications to which MLE is particularly suited.

This idea is implemented as a new feature of the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer, a system for mixed-initiative design of the type of levels you typically find in computer role playing games. The feature uses the MAP-Elites algorithm, an illumination algorithm which divides the population into a number of cells depending on their values along several behavioral dimensions. Users can flexibly and dynamically choose relevant dimensions of variation, and incorporate suggestions produced by the algorithm in their map designs. At the same time, any modifications performed by the human feed back into MAP-Elites, and are used to generate further suggestions."

  abstract: "Novelty search is a recent and promising approach to evolve neurocontrollers, especially to drive robots. The main idea is to maximize the novelty of behaviors instead of the efficiency. However, abandoning the efficiency objective(s) may be too radical in many contexts. In this paper, a Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithmis employed to reconcile novelty search with objective-based optimization by following a multiobjectivization process. Several multiobjectivizations based on behavioral novelty and on behavioral diversity are compared on a maze navigation task. Results show that the bi-objective variant “Novelty + Fitness” is better at fine-tuning behaviors than basic novelty search, while keeping a comparable number of iterations to converge."

  abstract: "Novelty search is a recent algorithm geared towards exploring search spaces without regard to objectives. When the presence of constraints divides a search space into feasible space and infeasible space, interesting implications arise regarding how novelty search explores such spaces. This paper elaborates on the problem of constrained novelty search and proposes two novelty search algorithms which search within both the feasible and the infeasible space. Inspired by the FI-2pop genetic algorithm, both algorithms maintain and evolve two separate populations, one with feasible and one with infeasible individuals, while each population can use its own selection method. The proposed algorithms are applied to the problem of generating diverse but playable game levels, which is representative of the larger problem of procedural game content generation. Results show that the two-population constrained novelty search methods can create, under certain conditions, larger and more diverse sets of feasible game levels than current methods of novelty search, whether constrained or unconstrained. However, the best algorithm is contingent on the particularities of the search space and the genetic operators used. Additionally, the proposed enhancement of offspring boosting is shown to enhance performance in all cases of two-population novelty search."

  abstract: "We introduce DeLeNoX (Deep Learning Novelty Explorer), a system that autonomously creates artifacts in constrained spaces according to its own evolving interestingness criterion. DeLeNoX proceeds in alternating phases of exploration and transformation. In the exploration phases, a version of novelty search augmented with constraint handling searches for maximally diverse artifacts using a given distance function. In the transformation phases, a deep learning autoencoder learns to compress the variation between the found artifacts into a lower-dimensional space. The newly trained encoder is then used as the basis for a new distance function, transforming the criteria for the next exploration phase. In the current paper, we apply DeLeNoX to the creation of spaceships suitable for use in two-dimensional arcade-style computer games, a representative problem in procedural content generation in games. We also situate DeLeNoX in relation to the distinction between exploratory and transformational creativity, and in relation to Schmidhuber’s theory of creativity through the drive for compression progress."

  abstract: "A grand challenge in reinforcement learning is intelligent exploration, especially when rewards are sparse or deceptive. Two Atari games serve as benchmarks for such hard-exploration domains: Montezuma's Revenge and Pitfall. On both games, current RL algorithms perform poorly, even those with intrinsic motivation, which is the dominant method to improve performance on hard-exploration domains. To address this shortfall, we introduce a new algorithm called Go-Explore. It exploits the following principles: (1) remember previously visited states, (2) first return to a promising state (without exploration), then explore from it, and (3) solve simulated environments through any available means (including by introducing determinism), then robustify via imitation learning. The combined effect of these principles is a dramatic performance improvement on hard-exploration problems. On Montezuma's Revenge, Go-Explore scores a mean of over 43k points, almost 4 times the previous state of the art. Go-Explore can also harness human-provided domain knowledge and, when augmented with it, scores a mean of over 650k points on Montezuma's Revenge. Its max performance of nearly 18 million surpasses the human world record, meeting even the strictest definition of \"superhuman\" performance. On Pitfall, Go-Explore with domain knowledge is the first algorithm to score above zero. Its mean score of almost 60k points exceeds expert human performance. Because Go-Explore produces high-performing demonstrations automatically and cheaply, it also outperforms imitation learning work where humans provide solution demonstrations. Go-Explore opens up many new research directions into improving it and weaving its insights into current RL algorithms. It may also enable progress on previously unsolvable hard-exploration problems in many domains, especially those that harness a simulator during training (e.g. robotics)."

  abstract: "Quality diversity (QD) algorithms such as MAP-Elites have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional single-objective optimization methods. They were initially applied to evolutionary robotics problems such as locomotion and maze navigation, but have yet to see widespread application. We argue that these algorithms are perfectly suited to the rich domain of video games, which contains many relevant problems with a multitude of successful strategies and often also multiple dimensions along which solutions can vary. This paper introduces a novel modification of the MAP-Elites algorithm called MAP-Elites with Sliding Boundaries (MESB) and applies it to the design and rebalancing of Hearthstone, a popular collectible card game chosen for its number of multidimensional behavior features relevant to particular styles of play. To avoid overpopulating cells with conflated behaviors, MESB slides the boundaries of cells based on the distribution of evolved individuals. Experiments in this paper demonstrate the performance of MESB in Hearthstone. Results suggest MESB finds diverse ways of playing the game well along the selected behavioral dimensions. Further analysis of the evolved strategies reveals common patterns that recur across behavioral dimensions and explores how MESB can help rebalance the game."

  abstract: "Repertoire-based learning is a data-efficient adaptation approach based on a two-step process in which (1) a large and diverse set of policies is learned in simulation, and (2) a planning or learning algorithm chooses the most appropriate policies according to the current situation (e.g., a damaged robot, a new object, etc.). In this paper, we relax the assumption of previous works that a single repertoire is enough for adaptation. Instead, we generate repertoires for many different situations (e.g., with a missing leg, on different floors, etc.) and let our algorithm selects the most useful prior. Our main contribution is an algorithm, APROL (Adaptive Prior selection for Repertoire-based Online Learning) to plan the next action by incorporating these priors when the robot has no information about the current situation. We evaluate APROL on two simulated tasks: (1) pushing unknown objects of various shapes and sizes with a robotic arm and (2) a goal reaching task with a damaged hexapod robot. We compare with \"Reset-free Trial and Error\" (RTE) and various single repertoire-based baselines. The results show that APROL solves both the tasks in less interaction time than the baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate APROL on a real, damaged hexapod that quickly learns to pick compensatory policies to reach a goal by avoiding obstacles in the path."

  abstract: "The high probability of hardware failures prevents many advanced robots (e.g., legged robots) from being confidently deployed in real-world situations (e.g., post-disaster rescue). Instead of attempting to diagnose the failures, robots could adapt by trial-and-error in order to be able to complete their tasks. In this situation, damage recovery can be seen as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. However, the best RL algorithms for robotics require the robot and the environment to be reset to an initial state after each episode, that is, the robot is not learning autonomously. In addition, most of the RL methods for robotics do not scale well with complex robots (e.g., walking robots) and either cannot be used at all or take too long to converge to a solution (e.g., hours of learning). In this paper, we introduce a novel learning algorithm called “Reset-free Trial-and-Error” (RTE) that (1) breaks the complexity by pre-generating hundreds of possible behaviors with a dynamics simulator of the intact robot, and (2) allows complex robots to quickly recover from damage while completing their tasks and taking the environment into account. We evaluate our algorithm on a simulated wheeled robot, a simulated six-legged robot, and a real six-legged walking robot that are damaged in several ways (e.g., a missing leg, a shortened leg, faulty motor, etc.) and whose objective is to reach a sequence of targets in an arena. Our experiments show that the robots can recover most of their locomotion abilities in an environment with obstacles, and without any human intervention."

  abstract: "We focus on the challenge of finding a diverse collection of quality solutions on complex continuous domains. While quality diver-sity (QD) algorithms like Novelty Search with Local Competition (NSLC) and MAP-Elites are designed to generate a diverse range of solutions, these algorithms require a large number of evaluations for exploration of continuous spaces. Meanwhile, variants of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) are among the best-performing derivative-free optimizers in single-objective continuous domains. This paper proposes a new QD algorithm called Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME). Our new algorithm combines the self-adaptation techniques of CMA-ES with archiving and mapping techniques for maintaining diversity in QD. Results from experiments based on standard continuous optimization benchmarks show that CMA-ME finds better-quality solutions than MAP-Elites; similarly, results on the strategic game Hearthstone show that CMA-ME finds both a higher overall quality and broader diversity of strategies than both CMA-ES and MAP-Elites. Overall, CMA-ME more than doubles the performance of MAP-Elites using standard QD performance metrics. These results suggest that QD algorithms augmented by operators from state-of-the-art optimization algorithms can yield high-performing methods for simultaneously exploring and optimizing continuous search spaces, with significant applications to design, testing, and reinforcement learning among other domains."

  abstract: "Quality Diversity algorithms (QD) evolve a set of high-performing phenotypes that each behaves as differently as possible.

In fact, many of the promising applications of QD algorithms, for instance, games and robotics, are stochastic. Here we propose two new extensions to the QD-algorithm MAP-Elites adaptive sampling and drifting-elites — and demonstrate empirically that these extensions increase the quality of solutions in a noisy artificial test function and the behavioral diversity in a 2D bipedal walker environment."

  abstract: "Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, and MAP-Elites (ME) in particular, have proven very useful for a broad range of applications including enabling real robots to recover quickly from joint damage, solving strongly deceptive maze tasks or evolving robot morphologies to discover new gaits. However, present implementations of MAP-Elites and other QD algorithms seem to be limited to low-dimensional controllers with far fewer parameters than modern deep neural network models. In this paper, we propose to leverage the efficiency of Evolution Strategies (ES) to scale MAP-Elites to high-dimensional controllers parameterized by large neural networks. We design and evaluate a new hybrid algorithm called MAP-Elites with Evolution Strategies (ME-ES) for post-damage recovery in a difficult high-dimensional control task where traditional ME fails. Additionally, we show that ME-ES performs efficient exploration, on par with state-of-the-art exploration algorithms in high-dimensional control tasks with strongly deceptive rewards."

In MAP-Elites, the choice of the behaviour space is essential for adaptation, the recovery of performance in unseen environments , since it defines the diversity of the solutions. Current practice is to hand-code a set of behavioural features, however, given the large space of possible behaviour-performance maps, the designer does not know a priori which behavioural features maximise a map's adaptation potential. We introduce a new meta-evolution algorithm that discovers those behavioural features that maximise future adaptations. The proposed method applies Covari-ance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy to evolve a population of behaviour-performance maps to maximise a meta-fitness function that rewards adaptation. The method stores solutions found by MAP-Elites in a database which allows to rapidly construct new behaviour-performance maps on-the-fly. To evaluate this system , we study the gait of the RHex robot as it adapts to a range of damages sustained on its legs. When compared to MAP-Elites with user-defined behaviour spaces, we demonstrate that the meta-evolution system learns high-performing gaits with or without damages injected to the robot. "

  abstract: "Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms are a recent family of optimization algorithms that search for a large set of diverse but high-performing solutions. In some specific situations, they can solve multiple tasks at once. For instance, they can find the joint positions required for a robotic arm to reach a set of points, which can also be solved by running a classic optimizer for each target point. However, they cannot solve multiple tasks when the fitness needs to be evaluated independently for each task (e.g., optimizing policies to grasp many different objects). In this paper, we propose an extension of the MAP-Elites algorithm, called Multi-task MAP-Elites, that solves multiple tasks when the fitness function depends on the task. We evaluate it on a simulated parameterized planar arm (10-dimensional search space; 5000 tasks) and on a simulated 6-legged robot with legs of different lengths (36-dimensional search space; 2000 tasks). The results show that in both cases our algorithm outperforms the optimization of each task separately with the CMA-ES algorithm. "

  abstract: "The encoding of solutions in black-box optimization is a delicate, handcrafted balance between expressiveness and domain knowledge between exploring a wide variety of solutions, and ensuring that those solutions are useful. Our main insight is that this process can be automated by generating a dataset of high-performing solutions with a quality diversity algorithm (here, MAP-Elites), then learning a representation with a generative model (here, a Varia-tional Autoencoder) from that dataset. Our second insight is that this representation can be used to scale quality diversity optimization to higher dimensions-but only if we carefully mix solutions generated with the learned representation and those generated with traditional variation operators. We demonstrate these capabilities by learning an low-dimensional encoding for the inverse kinemat-ics of a thousand joint planar arm. The results show that learned representations make it possible to solve high-dimensional problems with orders of magnitude fewer evaluations than the standard MAP-Elites, and that, once solved, the produced encoding can be used for rapid optimization of novel, but similar, tasks. The presented techniques not only scale up quality diversity algorithms to high dimensions, but show that black-box optimization encodings can be automatically learned, rather than hand designed. "

  year: 2020
  abstract: "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proving to be a powerful indirect genotype-to-phenotype mapping for evolutionary search, but they have limitations. In particular, GAN output does not scale to arbitrary dimensions, and there is no obvious way of combining multiple GAN outputs into a cohesive whole, which would be useful in many areas, such as the generation of video game levels. Game levels often consist of several segments, sometimes repeated directly or with variation, organized into an engaging pattern. Such patterns can be produced with Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs). Specifically, a CPPN can define latent vector GAN inputs as a function of geometry, which provides a way to organize level segments output by a GAN into a complete level. This new CPPN2GAN approach is validated in both Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda. Specifically, divergent search via MAP-Elites demonstrates that CPPN2GAN can better cover the space of possible levels. The layouts of the resulting levels are also more cohesive and aesthetically consistent. "

  abstract: "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful indirect genotype-to-phenotype mapping for evolutionary search. Much previous work applying GANs to level generation focuses on fixed-size segments combined into a whole level, but individual segments may not fit together cohesively. In contrast, segments in human designed levels are often repeated, directly or with variation, and organized into patterns (the symmetric eagle in Level 1 of The Legend of Zelda, or repeated pipe motifs in Super Mario Bros). Such patterns can be produced with Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs). CPPNs define latent vector GAN inputs as a function of geometry, organizing segments output by a GAN into complete levels. However, collections of latent vectors can also be evolved directly, producing more chaotic levels. We propose a hybrid approach that evolves CPPNs first, but allows latent vectors to evolve later, combining the benefits of both approaches. These approaches are evaluated in Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda. We previously demonstrated via a Quality-Diversity algorithm that CPPNs better cover the space of possible levels than directly evolved levels. Here, we show that the hybrid approach (1) covers areas that neither of the other methods can, and (2) achieves comparable or superior QD scores."

  authors:

  year: 2020
  abstract: "In swarm robotics, any of the robots in a swarm may be affected by different faults, resulting in significant performance declines. To allow fault recovery from randomly injected faults to different robots in a swarm, a model-free approach may be preferable due to the accumulation of faults in models and the difficulty to predict the behaviour of neighbouring robots. One model-free approach to fault recovery involves two phases: during simulation, a quality-diversity algorithm evolves a behaviourally diverse archive of controllers; during the target application, a search for the best controller is initiated after fault injection. In quality-diversity algorithms, the choice of the behavioural descriptor is a key design choice that determines the quality of the evolved archives, and therefore the fault recovery performance. Although the environment is an important determinant of behaviour, the impact of environmental diversity is often ignored in the choice of a suitable behavioural descriptor. This study compares different behavioural descriptors, including two generic descriptors that work on a wide range of tasks, one hand-coded descriptor which fits the domain of interest, and one novel type of descriptor based on environmental diversity, which we call Quality-Environment-Diversity (QED). Results demonstrate that the above-mentioned model-free approach to fault recovery is feasible in the context of swarm robotics, reducing the fault impact by a factor 2-3. Further, the environmental diversity obtained with QED yields a unique behavioural diversity profile that allows it to recover from high-impact faults. "

  abstract: "Programming a robot to deal with open-ended tasks remains a challenge, in particular if the robot has to manipulate objects. Launching, grasping, pushing or any other object interaction can be simulated but the corresponding models are not reversible and the robot behavior thus cannot be directly deduced. These behaviors are hard to learn without a demonstration as the search space is large and the reward sparse. We propose a method to autonomously generate a diverse repertoire of simple object interaction behaviors in simulation. Our goal is to bootstrap a robot learning and development process with limited informations about what the robot has to achieve and how. This repertoire can be exploited to solve different tasks in reality thanks to a proposed adaptation method or could be used as a training set for data-hungry algorithms. The proposed approach relies on the definition of a goal space and generates a repertoire of trajectories to reach attainable goals, thus allowing the robot to control this goal space. The repertoire is built with an off-the-shelf simulation thanks to a quality diversity algorithm. The result is a set of solutions tested in simulation only. It may result in two different problems: (1) as the repertoire is discrete and finite, it may not contain the trajectory to deal with a given situation or (2) some trajectories may lead to a behavior in reality that differs from simulation because of a reality gap. We propose an approach to deal with both issues by using a local linearization between the motion parameters and the observed effects. Furthermore, we present an approach to update the existing solution repertoire with the tests done on the real robot. The approach has been validated on two different experiments on the Baxter robot: a ball launching and a joystick manipulation tasks. "

  abstract: "Exploration of the search space through the optimisation of phenotypic diversity is of increasing interest within the field of evolutionary robotics. Novelty search and the more recent MAP-Elites are two state of the art evolutionary algorithms which diversify low dimensional phenotypic traits for divergent exploration. In this paper we introduce a novel alternative for rapid divergent search of the feature space. Unlike previous phenotypic search procedures, our proposed Spatial, Hierarchical, Illuminated Neuro-Evolution (SHINE) algorithm utilises a tree structure for the maintenance and selection of potential candidates. SHINE penalises previous solutions in more crowded areas of the landscape. Our experimental results show that SHINE significantly outperforms novelty search and MAP-Elites in both performance and exploration. We conclude that the SHINE algorithm is a viable method for rapid divergent search of low dimensional, phenotypic landscapes."

  abstract: "Quality-Diversity optimisation algorithms enable the evolution of collections of both high-performing and diverse solutions. These collections offer the possibility to quickly adapt and switch from one solution to another in case it is not working as expected. It therefore finds many applications in real-world domain problems such as robotic control. However, QD algorithms, like most optimisation algorithms, are very sensitive to uncertainty on the fitness function, but also on the behavioural descriptors. Yet, such uncertainties are frequent in real-world applications. Few works have explored this issue in the specific case of QD algorithms, and inspired by the literature in Evolutionary Computation, mainly focus on using sampling to approximate the true value of the performances of a solution. However, sampling approaches require a high number of evaluations, which in many applications such as robotics, can quickly become impractical. In this work, we propose Deep-Grid MAP-Elites, a variant of the MAP-Elites algorithm that uses an archive of similar previously encountered solutions to approximate the performance of a solution. We compare our approach to previously explored ones on three noisy tasks: a standard optimisation task, the control of a redundant arm and a simulated Hexapod robot. The experimental results show that this simple approach is significantly more resilient to noise on the behavioural descriptors, while achieving competitive performances in terms of fitness optimisation, and being more sample-efficient than other existing approaches."

The feature uses the MAP-Elites algorithm, an illumination algorithm that segregates the population among several cells depending on their scores with respect to different behavioral dimensions. Users can flexibly and dynamically alternate between these dimensions anytime, thus guiding the evolutionary process in an intuitive way, and then incorporate suggestions produced by the algorithm in their room designs. At the same time, any modifications performed by the human user will feed back into MAP-Elites, closing a circular workflow of constant mutual inspiration. This paper presents the algorithm followed by an in-depth analysis of its behaviour, with the aims of evaluating the expressive range of all possible dimension combinations in several scenarios, as well as discussing their influence in the fitness landscape and in the overall performance of the mixed-initiative procedural content generation.

  abstract: "We present a collaborative mixed-initiative system for building levels for the puzzle game 'Baba is You'. Unlike previous mixed-initiative systems, Baba is Y'all is designed for collaborative asynchronous creation by multiple users over the internet. The system includes several AI-assisted features to help designers, including a level evolver and an automated player for playtesting. The level archives catalogues levels according to which mechanics are implemented and not implemented, allowing the system to ask users to design levels with specific combinations of mechanics. We describe the operation of the system and the results of small-scale informal user test, and discuss future development paths for this system as well as for collaborative mixed-initiative systems in general.

  abstract: "Hanabi is a cooperative game that brings the problem of modeling other players to the forefront. In this game, coordinated groups of players can leverage pre-established conventions to great effect, but playing in an ad-hoc setting requires agents to adapt to its partner's strategies with no previous coordination. Evaluating an agent in this setting requires a diverse population of potential partners, but so far, the behavioral diversity of agents has not been considered in a systematic way. This paper proposes Quality Diversity algorithms as a promising class of algorithms to generate diverse populations for this purpose, and generates a population of diverse Hanabi agents using MAP-Elites. We also postulate that agents can benefit from a diverse population during training and implement a simple 'meta-strategy' for adapting to an agent's perceived behavioral niche. We show this meta-strategy can work better than generalist strategies even outside the population it was trained with if its partner's behavioral niche can be correctly inferred, but in practice a partner's behavior depends and interferes with the meta-agent's own behavior, suggesting an avenue for future research in characterizing another agent's behavior during gameplay.

  abstract: " We combine MAP-Elites and highly parallelisable simulation to explore the design space of a class of large legged robots, which stand at around 2m tall and whose design and construction is not well-studied. The simulation is modified to account for factors such as motor torque and weight, and presents a reasonable fidelity search space. A novel robot encoding allows for bio-inspired features such as legs scaling along the length of the body. The impact of three possible control generation schemes are assessed in the context of body-brain co-evolution, showing that even constrained problems benefit strongly from coupling-promoting mechanisms. A two stage process in implemented. In the first stage, a library of possible robots is generated, treating user requirements as constraints. In the second stage, the most promising robot niches are analysed and a suite of human-understandable design rules generated related to the values of their feature variables. These rules, together with the library, are then ready to be used by a (human) robot designer as a Design Assist tool. "

  abstract: "Robots operating in the real world will experience a range of different environments and tasks. It is essential for the robot to have the ability to adapt to its surroundings to work efficiently in changing conditions. Evolutionary robotics aims to solve this by optimizing both the control and body (morphology) of a robot, allowing adaptation to internal, as well as external factors. Most work in this field has been done in physics simulators, which are relatively simple and not able to replicate the richness of interactions found in the real world. Solutions that rely on the complex interplay between control, body, and environment are therefore rarely found. In this paper, we rely solely on real-world evaluations and apply evolutionary search to yield combinations of morphology and control for our mechanically self-reconfiguring quadruped robot. We evolve solutions on two very different physical surfaces and analyze the results in terms of both control and morphology. We then transition to two previously unseen surfaces to demonstrate the generality of our method. We find that the evolutionary search adapts both control and body to the different physical environments, yielding significantly different morphology-controller configurations. Moreover, we observe that the solutions found by our method work well on previously unseen terrains. "

  abstract: "Methods for dynamic difficulty adjustment allow games to be tailored to particular players to maximize their engagement. However, current methods often only modify a limited set of game features such as the difficulty of the opponents, or the availability of resources. Other approaches, such as experience-driven Procedural Content Generation (PCG), can generate complete levels with desired properties such as levels that are neither too hard nor too easy, but require many iterations. This paper presents a method that can generate and search for complete levels with a specific target difficulty in only a few trials. This advance is enabled by through an Intelligent Trial-and-Error algorithm, originally developed to allow robots to adapt quickly. Our algorithm first creates a large variety of different levels that vary across predefined dimensions such as leniency or map coverage. The performance of an AI playing agent on these maps gives a proxy for how difficult the level would be for another AI agent (e.g. one that employs Monte Carlo Tree Search instead of Greedy Tree Search); using this information, a Bayesian Optimization procedure is deployed, updating the difficulty of the prior map to reflect the ability of the agent. The approach can reliably find levels with a specific target difficulty for a variety of planning agents in only a few trials, while maintaining an understanding of their skill landscape. "

  abstract: "In the past few years, there has been considerable activity in both academic and industrial research to develop innovative machine learning approaches to locate novel, high-performing molecules in chemical space. Here we describe a new and fundamentally different type of approach that provides a holistic overview of how high-performing molecules are distributed throughout a search space. Based on an open-source, graph-based implementation [Jensen, Chem. Sci., 2019, 12, 3567-3572] of a traditional genetic algorithm for molecular optimisation, and influenced by state-of-the-art concepts from soft robot design [Mouret et al., IEEE Trans. Evolut. Comput., 2016, 22, 623-630], we provide an algorithm that (i) produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different molecules, (ii) illuminates the distribution of optimal solutions, and (iii) improves search efficiency compared to both machine learning and traditional genetic algorithm approaches."

  abstract: "Exploration is a key problem in reinforcement learning, since agents can only learn from data they acquire in the environment. With that in mind, maintaining a population of agents is an attractive method, as it allows data be collected with a diverse set of behaviors. This behavioral diversity is often boosted via multi-objective loss functions. However, those approaches typically leverage mean field updates based on pairwise distances, which makes them susceptible to cycling behaviors and increased redundancy. In addition, explicitly boosting diversity often has a detrimental impact on optimizing already fruitful behaviors for rewards. As such, the reward-diversity trade off typically relies on heuristics. Finally, such methods require behavioral representations, often handcrafted and domain specific. In this paper, we introduce an approach to optimize all members of a population simultaneously. Rather than using pairwise distance, we measure the volume of the entire population in a behavioral manifold, defined by task-agnostic behavioral embeddings. In addition, our algorithm Diversity via Determinants (DvD), adapts the degree of diversity during training using online learning techniques. We introduce both evolutionary and gradient-based instantiations of DvD and show they effectively improve exploration without reducing performance when better exploration is not required."

  abstract: "Despite recent progress in robot learning, it still remains a challenge to program a robot to deal with open-ended object manipulation tasks. One approach that was recently used to autonomously generate a repertoire of diverse skills is a novelty based Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithm. However, as most evolutionary algorithms, QD suffers from sample- inefficiency and, thus, it is challenging to apply it in real-world scenarios. This paper tackles this problem by integrating a neural network that predicts the behavior of the perturbed parameters into a novelty based QD algorithm. In the proposed Model-based Quality-Diversity search (M-QD), the network is trained concurrently to the repertoire and is used to avoid executing unpromising actions in the novelty search process. Furthermore, it is used to adapt the skills of the final repertoire in order to generalize the skills to different scenarios. Our experiments show that enhancing a QD algorithm with such a forward model improves the sample-efficiency and performance of the evolutionary process and the skill adaptation."

  abstract: "Evolution gave rise to creatures that are arguably more sophisticated than the greatest human-designed systems. This feat has inspired computer scientists since the advent of computing and led to optimization tools that can evolve complex neural networks for machines—an approach known as “neuroevolution.” After a few successes in designing evolvable representations for high-dimensional artifacts, the field has been recently revitalized by going beyond optimization: to many, the wonder of evolution is less in the perfect optimization of each species than in the creativity of such a simple iterative process, that is, in the diversity of species. This modern view of artificial evolution is moving the field away from microevolution, following a fitness gradient in a niche, to macroevolution, filling many niches with highly different species. It already opened promising applications, like evolving gait repertoires, video game levels for different tastes, and diverse designs for aerodynamic bikes."

  abstract: "In Evolutionary Robotics a population of solutions is evolved to optimize robots that solve a given task. However, in traditional Evolutionary Algorithms, the population of solutions tends to converge to local optima when the problem is complex or the search space is large, a problem known as premature convergence. Quality Diversity algorithms try to overcome premature convergence by introducing additional measures that reward solutions for being different while not necessarily performing better. In this paper we compare a single objective Evolutionary Algorithm with two diversity promoting search algorithms; a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm and MAP-Elites a Quality Diversity algorithm, for the difficult problem of evolving control and morphology in modular robotics. We compare their ability to produce high performing solutions, in addition to analyze the evolved morphological diversity. The results show that all three search algorithms are capable of evolving high performing individuals. However, the Quality Diversity algorithm is better adept at filling all niches with high-performing solutions. This confirms that Quality Diversity algorithms are well suited for evolving modular robots and can be an important means of generating repertoires of high performing solutions that can be exploited both at design- and runtime."

  abstract: "As open-ended learning based on divergent search algorithms such as Novelty Search (NS) draws more and more attention from the research community, it is natural to expect that its application to increasingly complex real-world problems will require the exploration to operate in higher dimensional Behavior Spaces which will not necessarily be Euclidean. Novelty Search traditionally relies on k-nearest neighbours search and an archive of previously visited behavior descriptors which are assumed to live in a Euclidean space. This is problematic because of a number of issues. On one hand, Euclidean distance and Nearest-neighbour search are known to behave differently and become less meaningful in high dimensional spaces. On the other hand, the archive has to be bounded since, memory considerations aside, the computational complexity of finding nearest neighbours in that archive grows linearithmically with its size. A sub-optimal bound can result in 'cycling' in the behavior space, which inhibits the progress of the exploration. Furthermore, the performance of NS depends on a number of algorithmic choices and hyperparameters, such as the strategies to add or remove elements to the archive and the number of neighbours to use in k-nn search. In this paper, we discuss an alternative approach to novelty estimation, dubbed Behavior Recognition based Novelty Search (BR-NS), which does not require an archive, makes no assumption on the metrics that can be defined in the behavior space and does not rely on nearest neighbours search. We conduct experiments to gain insight into its feasibility and dynamics as well as potential advantages over archive-based NS in terms of time complexity."

  abstract: "Designing optimal soft modular robots is difficult, due to non-trivial interactions between morphology and controller. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), combined with physical simulators, represent a valid tool to overcome this issue. In this work, we investigate algorithmic solutions to improve the Quality Diversity of co-evolved designs of Tensegrity Soft Modular Robots (TSMRs) for two robotic tasks, namely goal reaching and squeezing trough a narrow passage. To this aim, we use three different EAs, i.e., MAP-Elites and two custom algorithms: one based on Viability Evolution (ViE) and NEAT (ViE-NEAT), the other named Double Map MAP-Elites (DM-ME) and devised to seek diversity while co-evolving robot morphologies and neural network (NN)-based controllers. In detail, DM-ME extends MAP-Elites in that it uses two distinct feature maps, referring to morphologies and controllers respectively, and integrates a mechanism to automatically define the NN-related feature descriptor. Considering the fitness, in the goal-reaching task ViE-NEAT outperforms MAP-Elites and results equivalent to DM-ME. Instead, when considering diversity in terms of 'illumination' of the feature space, DM-ME outperforms the other two algorithms on both tasks, providing a richer pool of possible robotic designs, whereas ViE-NEAT shows comparable performance to MAP-Elites on goal reaching, although it does not exploit any map."

  abstract: "A core challenge of evolutionary search is the need to balance between exploration of the search space and exploitation of highly fit regions. Quality-diversity search has explicitly walked this tightrope between a population's diversity and its quality. This paper extends a popular quality-diversity search algorithm, MAP-Elites, by treating the selection of parents as a multi-armed bandit problem. Using variations of the upper-confidence bound to select parents from under-explored but potentially rewarding areas of the search space can accelerate the discovery of new regions as well as improve its archive's total quality. The paper tests an indirect measure of quality for parent selection: the survival rate of a parent's offspring. Results show that maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation leads to the most diverse and high-quality set of solutions in three different testbeds."

Among those algorithms, the recently introduced Covariance Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME) algorithm proposes the concept of emitters, which uses a predefined heuristic to drive the algorithm’s exploration. This algorithm was shown to outperform MAP-Elites, a popular QD algorithm that has demonstrated promising results in numerous applications. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Emitter MAP-Elites (ME-MAP-Elites), an algorithm that directly extends CMA-ME and improves its quality, diversity and data efficiency. It leverages the diversity of a heterogeneous set of emitters, in which each emitter type improves the optimisation process in different ways. A bandit algorithm dynamically finds the best selection of emitters depending on the current situation. We evaluate the performance of ME-MAP-Elites on six tasks, ranging from standard optimisation problems (in 100 dimensions) to complex locomotion tasks in robotics. Our comparisons against CMA-ME and MAP-Elites show that ME-MAP-Elites is faster at providing collections of solutions that are significantly more diverse and higher performing. Moreover, in cases where no fruitful synergy can be found between the different emitters, ME-MAP-Elites is equivalent to the best of the compared algorithms."

  abstract: "Quality-Diversity algorithms search for large collections of diverse and high-performing solutions, rather than just for a single solution like typical optimisation methods. They are specially adapted for multi-modal problems that can be solved in many different ways, such as complex reinforcement learning or robotics tasks. However, these approaches are highly dependent on the choice of feature descriptors (FDs) quantifying the similarity in behaviour of the solutions. While FDs usually needs to be hand-designed, recent studies have proposed ways to define them automatically by using feature extraction techniques, such as PCA or Auto-Encoders, to learn a representation of the problem from previously explored solutions. Here, we extend these approaches to more complex problems which cannot be efficiently explored by relying only on a single representation but require instead a set of diverse and complementary representations. We describe MC-AURORA, a Quality-Diversity approach that optimises simultaneously several collections of solutions, each with a different set of FDs, which are, in turn, defined automatically by an ensemble of modular auto-encoders. We show that this approach produces solutions that are more diverse than those produced by single-representation approaches. "

  abstract: "We consider multi-solution optimization and generative models for the generation of diverse artifacts and the discovery of novel solutions. In cases where the domain's factors of variation are unknown or too complex to encode manually, generative models can provide a learned latent space to approximate these factors. When used as a search space, however, the range and diversity of possible outputs are limited to the expressivity and generative capabilities of the learned model. We compare the output diversity of a quality diversity evolutionary search performed in two different search spaces: 1) a predefined parameterized space and 2) the latent space of a variational autoencoder model. We find that the search on an explicit parametric encoding creates more diverse artifact sets than searching the latent space. A learned model is better at interpolating between known data points than at extrapolating or expanding towards unseen examples. We recommend using a generative model's latent space primarily to measure similarity between artifacts rather than for search and generation. Whenever a parametric encoding is obtainable, it should be preferred over a learned representation as it produces a higher diversity of solutions."

  abstract: "Neuroevolution is an alternative to gradient-based optimisation that has the potential to avoid local minima and allows parallelisation. The main limiting factor is that usually it does not scale well with parameter space dimensionality. Inspired by recent work examining neural network intrinsic dimension and loss landscapes, we hypothesise that there exists a low-dimensional manifold, embedded in the policy network parameter space, around which a high-density of diverse and useful policies are located. This paper proposes a novel method for diversity-based policy search via Neuroevolution, that leverages learned representations of the policy network parameters, by performing policy search in this learned representation space. Our method relies on the Quality-Diversity (QD) framework which provides a principled approach to policy search, and maintains a collection of diverse policies, used as a dataset for learning policy representations. Further, we use the Jacobian of the inverse-mapping function to guide the search in the representation space. This ensures that the generated samples remain in the high-density regions, after mapping back to the original space. Finally, we evaluate our contributions on four continuous-control tasks in simulated environments, and compare to diversity-based baselines. "

  abstract: "Diversity-based approaches have recently gained popularity as an alternative paradigm to performance-based policy search. A popular approach from this family, Quality-Diversity (QD), maintains a collection of high-performing policies separated in the diversity-metric space, defined based on policies' rollout behaviours. When policies are parameterised as neural networks, i.e. Neuroevolution, QD tends to not scale well with parameter space dimensionality. Our hypothesis is that there exists a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the policy parameter space, containing a high density of diverse and feasible policies. We propose a novel approach to diversity-based policy search via Neuroevolution, that leverages learned latent representations of the policy parameters which capture the local structure of the data. Our approach iteratively collects policies according to the QD framework, in order to (i) build a collection of diverse policies, (ii) use it to learn a latent representation of the policy parameters, (iii) perform policy search in the learned latent space. We use the Jacobian of the inverse transformation (i.e.reconstruction function) to guide the search in the latent space. This ensures that the generated samples remain in the high-density regions of the original space, after reconstruction. We evaluate our contributions on three continuous control tasks in simulated environments, and compare to diversity-based baselines. The findings suggest that our approach yields a more efficient and robust policy search process."

  abstract: "Quality-Diversity optimization algorithms such as MAP-Elites, aimto generate collections of both diverse and high-performing solu-tions to an optimization problem. MAP-Elites has shown promisingresults in a variety of applications. In particular in evolutionaryrobotics tasks targeting the generation of behavioral repertoiresthat highlight the versatility of robots. However, for most robot-ics applications MAP-Elites is limited to using simple open-loopor low-dimensional controllers. Here we present Policy GradientAssisted MAP-Elites (PGA-MAP-Elites), a novel algorithm that en-ables MAP-Elites to efficiently evolve large neural network con-trollers by introducing a gradient-based variation operator inspiredby Deep Reinforcement Learning. This operator leverages gradi-ent estimates obtained from a critic neural network to rapidly findhigher-performing solutions and is paired with a traditional geneticvariation to maintain a divergent search behavior. The synergy ofthese operators makes PGA-MAP-Elites an efficient yet powerfulalgorithm for finding diverse and high-performing behaviors.

  abstract: "In modular robotics, modules can be reconfigured to change the morphology of the robot, making it able to adapt for specific tasks. However, optimizing both the body and control is a difficult challenge due to the intricate relationship between fine-tuning control and morphological changes that can invalidate such optimizations. To solve this challenge we compare three different Evolutionary Algorithms on their capacity to optimize morphologies in modular robotics. We compare two objective-based search algorithms, with MAP-Elites. To understand the benefit of diversity we transition the evolved populations into two difficult environments to see if diversity can have an impact on solving complex environments. In addition, we analyse the genealogical ancestry to shed light on the notion of stepping stones as key to enable high performance. The results show that MAP-Elites is capable of evolving the highest performing solutions in addition to generating the largest morphological diversity. For the transition between environments the results show that MAP-Elites is better at regaining performance by promoting morphological diversity. With the analysis of genealogical ancestry we show that MAP-Elites produces more diverse and higher performing stepping stones than the other objective-based search algorithms. Transitioning the populations to more difficult environments show the utility of morphological diversity, while the analysis of stepping stones show a strong correlation between diversity of ancestry and maximum performance on the locomotion task. The paper shows the advantage of promoting diversity for solving a locomotion task in different environments for modular robotics. By showing that the quality and diversity of stepping stones in Evolutionary Algorithms is an important factor for overall performance we have opened up a new area of analysis and results."

  abstract: "Traditional optimization algorithms search for a single global optimum that maximizes (or minimizes) the objective function. Multimodal optimization algorithms search for the highest peaks in the search space that can be more than one. Quality-Diversity algorithms are a recent addition to the evolutionary computation toolbox that do not only search for a single set of local optima, but instead try to illuminate the search space. In effect, they provide a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed throughout a search space. The main differences with multimodal optimization algorithms are that (1) Quality-Diversity typically works in the behavioral space (or feature space), and not in the genotypic (or parameter) space, and (2) Quality-Diversity attempts to fill the whole behavior space, even if the niche is not a peak in the fitness landscape. In this chapter, we provide a gentle introduction to Quality-Diversity optimization, discuss the main representative algorithms, and the main current topics under consideration in the community. Throughout the chapter, we also discuss several successful applications of Quality-Diversity algorithms, including deep learning, robotics, and reinforcement learning."

  abstract: "Quality-Diversity algorithms refer to a class of evolutionary algorithms designed to find a collection of diverse and high-performing solutions to a given problem. In robotics, such algorithms can be used for generating a collection of controllers covering most of the possible behaviours of a robot. To do so, these algorithms associate a behavioural descriptor to each of these behaviours. Each behavioural descriptor is used for estimating the novelty of one behaviour compared to the others. In most existing algorithms, the behavioural descriptor needs to be hand-coded, thus requiring prior knowledge about the task to solve. In this paper, we introduce: Autonomous Robots Realising their Abilities, an algorithm that uses a dimensionality reduction technique to automatically learn behavioural descriptors based on raw sensory data. The performance of this algorithm is assessed on three robotic tasks in simulation. The experimental results show that it performs similarly to traditional hand-coded approaches without the requirement to provide any hand-coded behavioural descriptor. In the collection of diverse and high-performing solutions, it also manages to find behaviours that are novel with respect to more features than its hand-coded baselines. Finally, we introduce a variant of the algorithm which is robust to the dimensionality of the behavioural descriptor space."

  abstract: "Rapid performance recovery from unforeseen environmental perturbations remains a grand challenge in swarm robotics. To solve this challenge, we investigate a behaviour adaptation approach, where one searches an archive of controllers for potential recovery solutions. To apply behaviour adaptation in swarm robotic systems, we propose two algorithms: (i) Swarm Map-based Optimisation (SMBO), which selects and evaluates one controller at a time, for a homogeneous swarm, in a centralised fashion; and (ii) Swarm Map-based Optimisation Decentralised (SMBO-Dec), which performs an asynchronous batch-based Bayesian optimisation to simultaneously explore different controllers for groups of robots in the swarm. We set up foraging experiments with a variety of disturbances: injected faults to proximity sensors, ground sensors, and the actuators of individual robots, with 100 unique combinations for each type. We also investigate disturbances in the operating environment of the swarm, where the swarm has to adapt to drastic changes in the number of resources available in the environment, and to one of the robots behaving disruptively towards the rest of the swarm, with 30 unique conditions for each such perturbation. The viability of SMBO and SMBO-Dec is demonstrated, comparing favourably to variants of random search and gradient descent, and various ablations, and improving performance up to 80% compared to the performance at the time of fault injection within at most 30 evaluations."

  abstract: "The multi-factor model is a widely used model in quantitative investment. The success of a multi-factor model is largely determined by the effectiveness of the alpha factors used in the model. This paper proposes a new evolutionary algorithm called AutoAlpha to automatically generate effective formulaic alphas from massive stock datasets. Specifically, first we discover an inherent pattern of the formulaic alphas and propose a hierarchical structure to quickly locate the promising part of space for search. Then we propose a new Quality Diversity search based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA-QD) to guide the search away from the well-explored space for more desirable results. Next, we utilize the warm start method and the replacement method to prevent the premature convergence problem. Based on the formulaic alphas we discover, we propose an ensemble learning-to-rank model for generating the portfolio. The backtests in the Chinese stock market and the comparisons with several baselines further demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoAlpha in mining formulaic alphas for quantitative trading."

  abstract: "Designing agents that are able to achieve different play-styles while maintaining a competitive level of play is a difficult task, especially for games for which the research community has not found super-human performance yet, like strategy games. These require the AI to deal with large action spaces, long-term planning and partial observability, among other well-known factors that make decision-making a hard problem. On top of this, achieving distinct play-styles using a general algorithm without reducing playing strength is not trivial. In this paper, we propose Portfolio Monte Carlo Tree Search with Progressive Unpruning for playing a turn-based strategy game (Tribes) and show how it can be parameterized so a quality-diversity algorithm (MAP-Elites) is used to achieve different play-styles while keeping a competitive level of play. Our results show that this algorithm is capable of achieving these goals even for an extensive collection of game levels beyond those used for training."

  abstract: "Multi-function swarms are swarms that solve multiple tasks at once. For example, a quadcopter swarm could be tasked with exploring an area of interest while simultaneously functioning as ad-hoc relays. With this type of multi-function comes the challenge of handling potentially conflicting requirements simultaneously. Using the Quality-Diversity algorithm MAP-elites in combination with a suitable controller structure, a framework for automatic behavior generation in multi-function swarms is proposed. The framework is tested on a scenario with three simultaneous tasks: exploration, communication network creation and geolocation of RF emitters. A repertoire is evolved, consisting of a wide range of controllers, or behavior primitives, with different characteristics and trade-offs in the different tasks. This repertoire would enable the swarm to transition between behavior trade-offs online, according to the situational requirements. Furthermore, the effect of noise on the behavior characteristics in MAP-elites is investigated. A moderate number of re-evaluations is found to increase the robustness while keeping the computational requirements relatively low. A few selected controllers are examined, and the dynamics of transitioning between these controllers are explored. Finally, the study develops a methodology for analyzing the makeup of the resulting controllers. This is done through a parameter variation study where the importance of individual inputs to the swarm controllers is assessed and analyzed."

With kernels based on f-divergence between the stationary distributions of policies, we convert the problem to that of efficient estimation of the ratio of these stationary distributions. We then study various distribution ratio estimators used previously for off-policy evaluation and imitation and re-purpose them to compute the gradients for policies in an ensemble such that the resultant population is diverse and of high-quality.

  abstract: "Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms are a class of population-based evolutionary algorithms designed to generate sets of solutions thatare both fit and diverse. In this paper, we describe a strategy for apply-ing  QD  concepts  to  the  generation  of  decision  tree  ensembles  by  op-timizing  collections  of  trees  for  both  individually  accurate  and  collec-tively diverse predictive behavior. We compare three variants of this QDstrategy  with  two  existing  ensemble  generation  strategies  over  severalclassification data sets. We then briefly highlight the effect of the evolu-tionary algorithm at the core of the strategy. The examined algorithmsgenerate  ensembles  with  distinct  predictive  behaviors  as  measured  byclassification accuracy and intrinsic diversity. The plotted behaviors hintat highly data-dependent relationships between these metrics. QD-basedstrategies are suggested as a means to optimize classifier ensembles alongthis performance curve along with other suggestions for future work."

  year: 2021
  abstract: "Constrained optimization problems are often characterized by multiple constraints that, in the practice, must be satisfied with different tolerance levels. While some constraints are hard and as such must be satisfied with zero-tolerance, others may be soft, such that non-zero violations are acceptable. Here, we evaluate the applicability of MAP-Elites to “illuminate” constrained search spaces by mapping them into feature spaces where each feature corresponds to a different constraint. On the one hand, MAP-Elites implicitly preserves diversity, thus allowing a good exploration of the search space. On the other hand, it provides an effective visualization that facilitates a better understanding of how constraint violations correlate with the objective function. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on a large set of benchmark problems, in various dimensionalities, and with different algorithmic configurations. As expected, numerical results show that a basic version of MAP-Elites cannot compete on all problems (especially those with equality constraints) with state-of-the-art algorithms that use gradient information or advanced constraint handling techniques. Nevertheless, it has a higher potential at finding constraint violations versus objectives trade-offs and providing new problem information. As such, it could be used in the future as an effective building-block for designing new constrained optimization algorithms."

  abstract: "More and more, optimization methods are used to find diverse solution sets. We compare solution diversity in multi-objective optimization, multimodal optimization, and quality diversity in a simple domain. We show that multiobjective optimization does not always produce much diversity, multimodal optimization produces higher fitness solutions, and quality diversity is not sensitive to genetic neutrality and creates the most diverse set of solutions. An autoencoder is used to discover phenotypic features automatically, producing an even more diverse solution set with quality diversity. Finally, we make recommendations about when to use which approach."

  abstract: "Robots are still limited to controlled conditions, that the robot designer knows with enough details to endow the robot with the appropriate models or behaviors. Learning algorithms add some flexibility with the ability to discover the appropriate behavior given either some demonstrations or a reward to guide its exploration with a reinforcement learning algorithm. Reinforcement learning algorithms rely on the definition of state and action spaces that define reachable behaviors. Their adaptation capability critically depends on the representations of these spaces: small and discrete spaces result in fast learning while large and continuous spaces are challenging and either require a long training period or prevent the robot from converging to an appropriate behavior. Beside the operational cycle of policy execution and the learning cycle, which works at a slower time scale to acquire new policies, we introduce the redescription cycle, a third cycle working at an even slower time scale to generate or adapt the required representations to the robot, its environment and the task. We introduce the challenges raised by this cycle and we present DREAM (Deferred Restructuring of Experience in Autonomous Machines), a developmental cognitive architecture to bootstrap this redescription process stage by stage, build new state representations with appropriate motivations, and transfer the acquired knowledge across domains or tasks or even across robots. We describe results obtained so far with this approach and end up with a discussion of the questions it raises in Neuroscience."

  abstract: "Creating open-ended algorithms, which generate their own never-ending stream of novel and appropriately challenging learning opportunities, could help to automate and accelerate progress in machine learning. A recent step in this direction is the Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET), an algorithm that generates and solves its own challenges, and allows solutions to goal-switch between challenges to avoid local optima. However, the original POET was unable to demonstrate its full creative potential because of limitations of the algorithm itself and because of external issues including a limited problem space and lack of a universal progress measure. Importantly, both limitations pose impediments not only for POET, but for the pursuit of open-endedness in general. Here we introduce and empirically validate two new innovations to the original algorithm, as well as two external innovations designed to help elucidate its full potential. Together, these four advances enable the most open-ended algorithmic demonstration to date. The algorithmic innovations are (1) a domain-general measure of how meaningfully novel new challenges are, enabling the system to potentially create and solve interesting challenges endlessly, and (2) an efficient heuristic for determining when agents should goal-switch from one problem to another (helping open-ended search better scale). Outside the algorithm itself, to enable a more definitive demonstration of open-endedness, we introduce (3) a novel, more flexible way to encode environmental challenges, and (4) a generic measure of the extent to which a system continues to exhibit open-ended innovation. Enhanced POET produces a diverse range of sophisticated behaviors that solve a wide range of environmental challenges, many of which cannot be solved through other means."

  abstract: "We propose the Interactive Constrained MAP-Elites, a quality-diversity solution for game content generation, implemented as a new feature of the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer: a mixed-initiative co-creativity tool for designing dungeons. The feature uses the MAP-Elites algorithm, an illumination algorithm that segregates the population among several cells depending on their scores with respect to different behavioral dimensions. Users can flexibly and dynamically alternate between these dimensions anytime, thus guiding the evolutionary process in an intuitive way, and then incorporate suggestions produced by the algorithm in their room designs. At the same time, any modifications performed by the human user will feed back into MAP-Elites, closing a circular workflow of constant mutual inspiration. This paper presents the algorithm followed by an in-depth analysis of its behaviour, with the aims of evaluating the expressive range of all possible dimension combinations in several scenarios, as well as discussing their influence in the fitness landscape and in the overall performance of the mixed-initiative procedural content generation.

  abstract: "Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms such as MAP-Elites are a class of optimisation techniques that attempt to find a set of high-performing points from an objective function while enforcing behavioural diversity of the points over one or more interpretable, user chosen, feature functions. In this paper we propose the Bayesian Optimisation of Elites (BOP-Elites) algorithm that uses techniques from Bayesian Optimisation to explicitly model both quality and diversity with Gaussian Processes. By considering user defined regions of the feature space as 'niches' our task is to find the optimal solution in each niche. We propose a novel acquisition function to intelligently choose new points that provide the highest expected improvement to the ensemble problem of identifying the best solution in every niche. In this way each function evaluation enriches our modelling and provides insight to the whole problem, naturally balancing exploration and exploitation of the search space. The resulting algorithm is very effective in identifying the parts of the search space that belong to a niche in feature space, and finding the optimal solution in each niche. It is also significantly more sample efficient than simpler benchmark approaches. BOP-Elites goes further than existing QD algorithms by quantifying the uncertainty around our predictions and offering additional illumination of the search space through surrogate models."

  abstract: "Several recent works have demonstrated the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) for both generating levels in the style of existing games as well as blending levels across different games. Additionally, quality-diversity (QD) algorithms have also become popular for generating varied game content by using evolution to explore a search space while focusing on both variety and quality. In order to reap the benefits of both these approaches, we present a level generation and game blending approach that combines the use of VAEs and QD algorithms. Specifically, we train VAEs on game levels and then run the MAP-Elites QD algorithm using the learned latent space of the VAE as the search space. The latent space captures the properties of the games whose levels we want to generate and blend, while MAP-Elites searches this latent space to find a diverse set of levels optimizing a given objective such as playability. We test our method using models for 5 different platformer games as well as a blended domain spanning 3 of these games. Our results show that using MAP-Elites in conjunction with VAEs enables the generation of a diverse set of playable levels not just for each individual game but also for the blended domain while illuminating game-specific regions of the blended latent space."

  abstract: "The growth of scale and complexity of interactions between humans and robots highlights the need for new computational methods to automatically evaluate novel algorithms and applications. Exploring the diverse scenarios of interaction between humans and robots in simulation can improve understanding of the system and avoid potentially costly failures in real-world settings. We formulate this as a quality diversity (QD) problem, where the goal is to discover diverse failure scenarios by simultaneously exploring both environments and human actions. We focus on the shared autonomy domain, where the robot attempts to infer the goal of a human operator, and adopt the QD algorithm MAP-Elites to generate scenarios for two published algorithms in this domain: shared autonomy via hindsight optimization and linear policy blending. Some of the generated scenarios confirm previous theoretical findings, while others are surprising and bring about a new understanding of state-of-the-art implementations. Our experiments show that MAP-Elites outperforms Monte-Carlo simulation and optimization based methods in effectively searching the scenario space, highlighting its promise for automatic evaluation of algorithms in shared autonomy."

However, less emphasis has been placed on the effect of the environment on coordination behaviors. To thoroughly explore environments that result in diverse behaviors, we propose a framework for procedural generation of environments that are (1) stylistically similar to human-authored environments, (2) guaranteed to be solvable by the human-robot team, and (3) diverse with respect to coordination measures. We analyze the procedurally generated environments in the Overcooked benchmark domain via simulation and an online user study.

  abstract: "The increasing importance of robots and automation creates a demand for learnable controllers which can be obtained through various approaches such as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unfortunately, these two families of algorithms have mainly developed independently and there are only a few works comparing modern EAs with deep RL algorithms. We show that Multidimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites), which is a modern EA, can deliver better-performing solutions than one of the state-of-the-art RL methods, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in the generation of locomotion controllers for a simulated hexapod robot. Additionally, extensive hyper-parameter tuning shows that MAP-Elites displays greater robustness across seeds and hyper-parameter sets. Generally, this paper demonstrates that EAs combined with modern computational resources display promising characteristics and have the potential to contribute to the state-of-the-art in controller learning."

  abstract: "Imitation Learning (IL) is a machine learning approach to learn a policy from a dataset of demonstrations. IL can be useful to kick-start learning before applying reinforcement learning (RL) but it can also be useful on its own, e.g. to learn to imitate human players in video games. However, a major limitation of current IL approaches is that they learn only a single 'average' policy based on a dataset that possibly contains demonstrations of numerous different types of behaviors. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Behavioral Repertoire Imitation Learning (BRIL) that instead learns a repertoire of behaviors from a set of demonstrations by augmenting the state-action pairs with behavioral descriptions. The outcome of this approach is a single neural network policy conditioned on a behavior description that can be precisely modulated. We apply this approach to train a policy on 7,777 human replays to perform build-order planning in StarCraft II. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to construct a low-dimensional behavioral space from the high-dimensional army unit composition of each demonstration. The results demonstrate that the learned policy can be effectively manipulated to express distinct behaviors. Additionally, by applying the UCB1 algorithm, we are able to adapt the behavior of the policy - in-between games - to reach a performance beyond that of the traditional IL baseline approach."

  abstract: "Reward-based optimization algorithms require both exploration, to find rewards, and exploitation, to maximize performance. The need for efficient exploration is even more significant in sparse reward settings, in which performance feedback is given sparingly, thus rendering it unsuitable for guiding the search process. In this work, we introduce the SparsE Reward Exploration via Novelty and Emitters (SERENE) algorithm, capable of efficiently exploring a search space, as well as optimizing rewards found in potentially disparate areas. Contrary to existing emitters-based approaches, SERENE separates the search space exploration and reward exploitation into two alternating processes. The first process performs exploration through Novelty Search, a divergent search algorithm. The second one exploits discovered reward areas through emitters, i.e. local instances of population-based optimization algorithms. A meta-scheduler allocates a global computational budget by alternating between the two processes, ensuring the discovery and efficient exploitation of disjoint reward areas. SERENE returns both a collection of diverse solutions covering the search space and a collection of high-performing solutions for each distinct reward area. We evaluate SERENE on various sparse reward environments and show it compares favorably to existing baselines."

  abstract: "In Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, which evolve a behaviourally diverse archive of high-performing solutions, the behaviour space is a difficult design choice that should be tailored to the target application. In QD meta-evolution, one evolves a population of QD algorithms to optimise the behaviour space based on an archive-level objective, the meta-fitness. This paper proposes an improved meta-evolution system such that (i) the database used to rapidly populate new archives is reformulated to prevent loss of quality-diversity; (ii) the linear transformation of base-features is generalised to a feature-map, a function of the base-features parametrised by the meta-genotype; and (iii) the mutation rate of the QD algorithm and the number of generations per meta-generation are controlled dynamically. Experiments on an 8-joint planar robot arm compare feature-maps (linear, non-linear, and feature-selection), parameter control strategies (static, endogenous, reinforcement learning, and annealing), and traditional MAP-Elites variants, for a total of 49 experimental conditions. Results reveal that non-linear and feature-selection feature-maps yield a 15-fold and 3-fold improvement in meta-fitness, respectively, over linear feature-maps. Reinforcement learning ranks among top parameter control methods. Finally, our approach allows the robot arm to recover a reach of over 80% for most damages and at least 60% for severe damages. "

  abstract: "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are capable of generating convincing imitations of elements from a training set, but the distribution of elements in the training set affects to difficulty of properly training the GAN and the quality of the outputs it produces. This paper looks at six different GANs trained on different subsets of data from the game Lode Runner. The quality diversity algorithm MAP-Elites was used to explore the set of quality levels that could be produced by each GAN, where quality was defined as being beatable and having the longest solution path possible. Interestingly, a GAN trained on only 20 levels generated the largest set of diverse beatable levels while a GAN trained on 150 levels generated the smallest set of diverse beatable levels, thus challenging the notion that more is always better when training GANs."

In a series of experiments, we generate novel urban designs for two real-world locations in Boston, Massachusetts. Combining the exploration of a possibility space with real-time performance evaluation creates a powerful new paradigm for architectural generative design that can extract and articulate design intelligence.

  abstract: "In this review we introduce the framework of reality-assisted evolution to summarize a growing trend towards combining model-based and model-free approaches to improve the design of physically embodied soft robots. In silico, data-driven models build, adapt and improve representations of the target system using real-world experimental data. By simulating huge numbers of virtual robots using these data-driven models, optimization algorithms can illuminate multiple design candidates for transference to the real world. In reality, large-scale physical experimentation facilitates the fabrication, testing and analysis of multiple candidate designs. Automated assembly and reconfigurable modular systems enable significantly higher numbers of real-world design evaluations than previously possible. Large volumes of ground-truth data gathered via physical experimentation can be returned to the virtual environment to improve data-driven models and guide optimization. Grounding the design process in physical experimentation ensures the complexity of virtual robot designs does not outpace the model limitations or available fabrication technologies. We outline key developments in the design of physically embodied soft robots under the framework of reality-assisted evolution."

  abstract: "In the last decade, reinforcement learning successfully solved complex control tasks and decision-making problems, like the Go board game. Yet, there are few success stories when it comes to deploying those algorithms to real-world scenarios. One of the reasons is the lack of guarantees when dealing with and avoiding unsafe states, a fundamental requirement in critical control engineering systems. In this paper, we introduce Guided Safe Shooting (GuSS), a model-based RL approach that can learn to control systems with minimal violations of the safety constraints. The model is learned on the data collected during the operation of the system in an iterated batch fashion, and is then used to plan for the best action to perform at each time step. We propose three different safe planners, one based on a simple random shooting strategy and two based on MAP-Elites, a more advanced divergent-search algorithm. Experiments show that these planners help the learning agent avoid unsafe situations while maximally exploring the state space, a necessary aspect when learning an accurate model of the system. Furthermore, compared to model-free approaches, learning a model allows GuSS reducing the number of interactions with the real-system while still reaching high rewards, a fundamental requirement when handling engineering systems."

  abstract: "In the past few years,a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to the exploitation of previous learning experiences and the design of Few-shot and Meta Learning approaches, in problem domains ranging from Computer Vision to Reinforcement Learning based control. A notable exception, where to the best of our knowledge, little to no effort has been made in this direction is Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization. QD methods have been shown to be effective tools in dealing with deceptive minima and sparse rewards in Reinforcement Learning. However, they remain costly due to their reliance on inherently sample inefficient evolutionary processes. We show that, given examples from a task distribution, information about the paths taken by optimization in parameter space can be leveraged to build a prior population, which when used to initialize QD methods in unseen environments, allows for few-shot adaptation. Our proposed method does not require backpropagation. It is simple to implement and scale, and furthermore, it is agnostic to the underlying models that are being trained. Experiments carried in both sparse and dense reward settings using robotic manipulation and navigation benchmarks show that it considerably reduces the number of generations that are required for QD optimization in these environments."

  abstract: "The Novelty Search (NS) algorithm was proposed more than a decade ago. However, the mechanisms behind its empirical success are still not well formalized/understood. This short note focuses on the effects of the archive on exploration. Experimental evidence from a few application domains suggests that archive-based NS performs in general better than when Novelty is solely computed with respect to the population. An argument that is often encountered in the literature is that the archive prevents exploration from backtracking or cycling, i.e. from revisiting previously encountered areas in the behavior space. We argue that this is not a complete or accurate explanation as backtracking —beside often being desirable —can actually be enabled by the archive. Through low-dimensional/analytical examples, we show that a key effect of the archive is that it counterbalances the exploration biases that result, among other factors, from the use of inadequate behavior metrics and the non-linearities of the behavior mapping. Our observations seem to hint that attributing a more active role to the archive in sampling can be beneficial."

  abstract: "While the field of Quality-Diversity (QD) has grown into a distinct branch of stochastic optimization, a few problems, in particular locomotion and navigation tasks, have become de facto standards. Are such benchmarks sufficient? Are they representative of the key challenges faced by QD algorithms? Do they provide the ability to focus on one particular challenge by properly disentangling it from others? Do they have much predictive power in terms of scalability and generalization? Existing benchmarks are not standardized, and there is currently no MNIST equivalent for QD. Inspired by recent works on Reinforcement Learning benchmarks, we argue that the identification of challenges faced by QD methods and the development of targeted, challenging, scalable but affordable benchmarks is an important step. As an initial effort, we identify three problems that are challenging in sparse reward settings, and propose associated benchmarks: (1) Behavior metric bias, which can result from the use of metrics that do not match the structure of the behavior space. (2) Behavioral Plateaus, with varying characteristics, such that escaping them would require adaptive QD algorithms and (3) Evolvability Traps, where small variations in genotype result in large behavioral changes. The environments that we propose satisfy the properties listed above."

  abstract: "Consider a walking agent that must adapt to damage. To approach this task, we can train a collection of policies and have the agent select a suitable policy when damaged. Training this collection may be viewed as a quality diversity (QD) optimization problem, where we search for solutions (policies) which maximize an objective (walking forward) while spanning a set of measures (measurable characteristics). Recent work shows that differentiable quality diversity (DQD) algorithms greatly accelerate QD optimization when exact gradients are available for the objective and measures. However, such gradients are typically unavailable in RL settings due to non-differentiable environments. To apply DQD in RL settings, we propose to approximate objective and measure gradients with evolution strategies and actor-critic methods. We develop two variants of the DQD algorithm CMA-MEGA, each with different gradient approximations, and evaluate them on four simulated walking tasks. One variant achieves comparable performance (QD score) with the state-of-the-art PGA-MAP-Elites in two tasks. The other variant performs comparably in all tasks but is less efficient than PGA-MAP-Elites in two tasks. These results provide insight into the limitations of CMA-MEGA in domains that require rigorous optimization of the objective and where exact gradients are unavailable."

  abstract: "Grasping a particular object may require a dedicated grasping movement that may also be specific to the robot end-effector. No generic and autonomous method does exist to generate these movements without making hypotheses on the robot or on the object. Learning methods could help to autonomously discover relevant grasping movements, but they face an important issue: grasping movements are so rare that a learning method based on exploration has little chance to ever observe an interesting movement, thus creating a bootstrap issue. We introduce an approach to generate diverse grasping movements in order to solve this problem. The movements are generated in simulation, for particular object positions. We test it on several simulated robots: Baxter, Pepper and a Kuka Iiwa arm. Although we show that generated movements actually work on a real Baxter robot, the aim is to use this method to create a large dataset to bootstrap deep learning methods."

  abstract: "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved significant successes, which aims to obtain a single policy maximizing the expected cumulative rewards for a given task. However, in many real-world scenarios, e.g., navigating in complex environments and controlling robots, one may need to find a set of policies having both high rewards and diverse behaviors, which can bring better exploration and robust few-shot adaptation. Recently, some methods have been developed by using evolutionary techniques, including iterative reproduction and selection of policies. However, due to the inefficient selection mechanisms, these methods cannot fully guarantee both high quality and diversity. In this paper, we propose EDO-CS, a new Evolutionary Diversity Optimization algorithm with Clustering-based Selection. In each iteration, the policies are divided into several clusters based on their behaviors, and a high-quality policy is selected from each cluster for reproduction. EDO-CS also adaptively balances the importance between quality and diversity in the reproduction process. Experiments on various (i.e., deceptive and multi-modal) continuous control tasks, show the superior performance of EDO-CS over previous methods, i.e., EDO-CS can achieve a set of policies with both high quality and diversity efficiently while previous methods cannot."

  abstract: "Generating agents that can achieve Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC) with unseen partners is a new challenge in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Recently, some studies have made progress in ZSC by exposing the agents to diverse partners during the training process. They usually involve self-play when training the partners, implicitly assuming that the tasks are homogeneous. However, many real-world tasks are heterogeneous, and hence previous methods may fail. In this paper, we study the heterogeneous ZSC problem for the first time and propose a general method based on coevolution, which coevolves two populations of agents and partners through three sub-processes: pairing, updating and selection. Experimental results on a collaborative cooking task show the necessity of considering the heterogeneous setting and illustrate that our proposed method is a promising solution for heterogeneous cooperative MARL."

  abstract: "Swarm robotics controllers are often automatically generated using methods of evolutionary computation with a task-specific fitness function to guide the optimization process. By contrast, our minimize surprise approach uses a task-independent fitness function to generate diverse behaviors over several independent evolutionary runs. Alternatives are divergent search algorithms rewarding behavioral novelty, such as novelty search, and quality-diversity algorithms generating diverse high-quality solutions, such as MAP-Elites. These approaches usually rely on task-dependent measures. We propose Minimize Surprise MAP-Elites, a task-independent MAP-Elites variant that combines MAP-Elites with our minimize surprise approach. Our first experiments result in high-quality solutions that lead to behavioral diversity across tasks and within tasks."

  abstract: "Recent progress in reinforcement learning (RL) has started producing generally capable agents that can solve a distribution of complex environments. These agents are typically tested on fixed, human-authored environments. On the other hand, quality diversity (QD) optimization has been proven to be an effective component of environment generation algorithms, which can generate collections of high-quality environments that are diverse in the resulting agent behaviors. However, these algorithms require potentially expensive simulations of agents on newly generated environments. We propose Deep Surrogate Assisted Generation of Environments (DSAGE), a sample-efficient QD environment generation algorithm that maintains a deep surrogate model for predicting agent behaviors in new environments. Results in two benchmark domains show that DSAGE significantly outperforms existing QD environment generation algorithms in discovering collections of environments that elicit diverse behaviors of a state-of-the-art RL agent and a planning agent.

  abstract: "Procedural Content Generation (PCG) algorithms provide a technique to generate complex and diverse environments in an automated way. However, while generating content with PCG methods is often straightforward, generating meaningful content that reflects specific intentions and constraints remains challenging. Furthermore, many PCG algorithms lack the ability to generate content in an open-ended manner. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be incredibly effective in many diverse domains. These trained LLMs can be fine-tuned, re-using information and accelerating training for new tasks. In this work, we introduce MarioGPT, a fine-tuned GPT2 model trained to generate tile-based game levels, in our case Super Mario Bros levels. We show that MarioGPT can not only generate diverse levels, but can be text-prompted for controllable level generation, addressing one of the key challenges of current PCG techniques. As far as we know, MarioGPT is the first text-to-level model. We also combine MarioGPT with novelty search, enabling it to generate diverse levels with varying play-style dynamics (i.e. player paths). This combination allows for the open-ended generation of an increasingly diverse range of content."

  abstract: "With the rapid progress in Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), researchers have studied how MAPF algorithms can be deployed to coordinate hundreds of robots in large automated warehouses. While most works try to improve the throughput of such warehouses by developing better MAPF algorithms, we focus on improving the throughput by optimizing the warehouse layout. We show that, even with state-of-the-art MAPF algorithms, commonly used human-designed layouts can lead to congestion for warehouses with large numbers of robots and thus have limited scalability. We extend existing automatic scenario generation methods to optimize warehouse layouts. Results show that our optimized warehouse layouts (1) reduce traffic congestion and thus improve throughput, (2) improve the scalability of the automated warehouses by doubling the number of robots in some cases, and (3) are capable of generating layouts with user-specified diversity measures.

  abstract: "Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of accomplishing a broad spectrum of tasks. Their abilities span numerous areas, and one area where they have made a significant impact is in the domain of code generation. In this context, we view LLMs as mutation and crossover tools. Meanwhile, Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms are known to discover diverse and\nrobust solutions. By merging the code-generating abilities of LLMs with the diversity and robustness of QD solutions, we introduce LLMatic, a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm. While LLMs struggle to conduct NAS directly through prompts, LLMatic uses a procedural approach, leveraging QD for prompts and network architecture to create diverse and highly performant networks. We test LLMatic on the CIFAR-10 image classification benchmark, demonstrating that it can produce competitive networks with just $2,000$ searches, even without prior knowledge of the benchmark domain or exposure to any previous top-performing models for the benchmark."

  abstract: "A Software Product Line (SPL) is a set of software products that are built from a variability model. Real-world SPLs typically involve a vast number of valid products, making it impossible to individually test each of them. This arises the need for automated test suite generation, which was previously modeled as either a single-objective or a multi-objective optimisation problem considering only objective functions. This article provides a completely diferent mathematical model by exploiting the beneits of Quality-Diversity (QD) optimisation that is composed of not only an objective function (e.g., t-wise coverage or test suite diversity) but also a user-deined behavior space (e.g., the space with test suite size as its dimension). We argue that the new model is more suitable and generic than the two alternatives because it provides at a time a large set of diverse (measured in the behavior space) and high-performing solutions that can ease the decision-making process. We apply MAP-Elites, one of the most popular QD algorithms, to solve the model. The results of the evaluation, on both realistic and artiicial SPLs, are promising, with MAP-Elites signiicantly and substantially outperforming both single- and multi-objective approaches, and also several state-of-the-art SPL testing tools. In summary, this paper provides a new and promising perspective on the test suite generation for SPLs."

  abstract: "Testing software product lines (SPLs) is difficult due to a huge number of possible products to be tested. Recently, there has been a growing interest in similarity-based testing of SPLs, where similarity is used as a surrogate metric for the t-wise coverage. In this context, one of the primary goals is to sample, by optimizing similarity metrics using search-based algorithms, a small subset of test cases (i.e., products) as dissimilar as possible, thus potentially making more t-wise combinations covered. Prior work has shown, by means of empirical studies, the great potential of current similarity-based testing approaches. However, the rationale of this testing technique deserves a more rigorous exploration. To this end, we perform correlation analyses to investigate how similarity metrics are correlated with the t-wise coverage. We find that similarity metrics generally have significantly positive correlations with the t-wise coverage. This well explains why similarity-based testing works, as the improvement on similarity metrics will potentially increase the t-wise coverage. Moreover, we explore, for the first time, the use of the novelty search (NS) algorithm for similarity-based SPL testing. The algorithm rewards “novel” individuals, i.e., those being different from individuals discovered previously, and this well matches the goal of similarity-based SPL testing. We find that the novelty score used in NS has (much) stronger positive correlations with the t-wise coverage than previous approaches relying on a genetic algorithm (GA) with a similarity-based fitness function. Experimental results on 31 software product lines validate the superiority of NS over GA, as well as other state-of-the-art approaches, concerning both t-wise coverage and fault detection capacity. Finally, we investigate whether it is useful to combine two satisfiability solvers when generating new individuals in NS, and how the performance of NS is affected by its key parameters. In summary, looking for novelty provides a promising way of sampling diverse test cases for SPLs."

  abstract: "Real-world software product lines (SPLs) often encompass enormous valid configurations that are impossible to enumerate. To understand properties of the space formed by all valid configurations, a feasible way is to select a small and valid sample set. Even though a number of sampling strategies have been proposed, they either fail to produce diverse samples with respect to the number of selected features (an important property to characterize behaviors of configurations), or achieve diverse sampling but with limited scalability (the handleable configuration space size is limited to 1013). To resolve this dilemma, we propose a scalable diverse sampling strategy, which uses a distance metric in combination with the novelty search algorithm to produce diverse samples in an incremental way. The distance metric is carefully designed to measure similarities between configurations, and further diversity of a sample set. The novelty search incrementally improves diversity of samples through the search for novel configurations. We evaluate our sampling algorithm on 39 real-world SPLs. It is able to generate the required number of samples for all the SPLs, including those which cannot be counted by sharpSAT, a state-of-the-art model counting solver. Moreover, it performs better than or at least competitively to state-of-the-art samplers regarding diversity of the sample set. Experimental results suggest that only the proposed sampler (among all the tested ones) achieves scalable diverse sampling."
